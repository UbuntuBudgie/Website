We are so impressed that the video is now featured on our [website](https://budgie-remix.org/) and [Sourceforge project page](https://sourceforge.net/projects/budgie-remix/)!\n- [Linux Scoop](http://linuxscoop.com/) has also made a great [screenshot tour of budgie-remix](http://linuxscoop.com/video/budgie-remix-16-04) on their website.\n- Reviews are coming thick and fast: here is a very useful [commentary based review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cnhKTUmnqM) showing you all the apps available out of the box.\n- The [linux subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/4kiocn/quick_look_budgie_remix_1604/) covered budgie-remix as well.\n\n#### FORTHCOMING OPPORTUNITIES\n\nMore opportunities exist to help out budgie-remix. If these sound interesting to you, please put your hand up. We would love to have you onboard as part of the development team. We will expand on these in the next few weeks, so remember to keep checking out our [Google+ community](https://plus.google.com/u/0/communities/106822666079268690759)page.\n\n- A small C based patch is required to allow us to **show the budgie-remix logo in the system Details** screen. At the moment, it is hard-coded with the Ubuntu GNOME logo.\n- HTML/CSS/Javascript & Python opportunities exist to further develop our **Welcome** app\n- **Debian packaging**: we need help tidying up our existing Debian packages to make them ready for possible inclusion into Debian/Ubuntu\n- **Wallpaper competition organizer**: help us get the best wallpapers for budgie-remix 16.10 users.\n- **App-Indicator applet**: fancy having a go at adding app-indicator support for budgie-remix?\n- **ISO testing**: we are coming up to 16.04.1 release and we’ll need help testing our 16.04.1 ISO images\n- **Translators**: we will need help translating our welcome app and the budgie-remix slideshow that you see on installation\n\n#### UPSTREAM BUDGIE DESKTOP\n\nThere has been a mass of updates upstream. It seems [Ikey](https://plus.google.com/u/0/+IkeyDoherty) (Budgie desktop maintainer) have been drinking lots of coffee over one overnight sprint! These are some of the highlights in the last fortnight:\n\n1. Adding applets has been made simpler by just double clicking the applet in the list\n2. Raven has been revamped – better animation and no more screen-tearing\n3. The various Switches in Raven will look much better with other themes in the future\n4. Raven will close when clicking on the desktop\n5. A new shortcut Super+A will be available to open up Raven’s applets section\n6. Adding new themes will be automatically visible in Raven rather than having to logout/login again","src/content/blog/2016/05/news-release-2.md",[146,147],"images/welcome-mockup.png","images/budgie-symbolic.jpg","b5998ff0266bb6d6",{"html":150,"metadata":151},"\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>This is the second of our fortnightly roundup of budgie-remix news.\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"https://google.com/+UdaraMadubhashana\">Udara\u003C/a> has been making some mockups of a \u003Cstrong>Welcome to budgie-remix\u003C/strong> app. This will be a distro agnostic development i.e., other distros can take and enhance/change it without having to rewrite everything.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg __ASTRO_IMAGE_=\"{&#x22;src&#x22;:&#x22;images/welcome-mockup.png&#x22;,&#x22;alt&#x22;:&#x22;welcome mockup&#x22;,&#x22;index&#x22;:0}\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"https://plus.google.com/u/0/+davidfossfreedommohammed\">David\u003C/a> has been refining our budgie-remix Budgie desktop Debian packages making it ready for inclusion in the main Debian repos.

We are also preparing the other budgie-remix packages for direct inclusion into Ubuntu.

Welcome to the team guys!\n\n#### OFFICIAL UBUNTU FLAVOR STATUS\n\nWe’ve had discussion with the official Ubuntu Technical Board regarding our application to become an official flavor. The good news is that they’ve said it will be possible.

We will be following these recommendation is the next weeks and months and will approach the technical board again.\n\n#### THEME POLL\n\nAs you already know, we ship two themes by default, Arc and Vertex. We’ve recently added a [poll on our Google+](https://plus.google.com/+davidfossfreedommohammed/posts/8iUtgoyA2wt) page, asking you, which one of the two we should push to 16.10 repos.

We’re proud to announce another release of budgie-remix. This time, we’re publishing the beta 2 for the new budgie-remix based on Ubuntu 16.10. While this beta is not final release, it does contain most of the bug fixes and new features that you are going to see with budgie-remix 16.10 final release.\n\n16.10 budgie-remix comes in both 64bit and 32bit ISO’s.  The final release will also include torrents. Download from our [SourceForge repository](https://sourceforge.net/projects/budgie-remix/files/16.10%20beta%202/) – remember to check out the README for current issues that we are aware of that may affect your installation.\n\n[![download_now](images/download_now.png)](https://sourceforge.net/projects/budgie-remix/files/16.10%20beta%202/)\n\nIf you have previously installed the alpha or beta 1 version of budgie-remix 16.10 we would ask you to please reinstall this beta 2 – this will allow us catch those last minute installation issues.\n\nOne of the most notable changes is the new Budgie Desktop version 10.2.7 update by our Solus friends. This new version of Budgie desktop comes with a much needed keyboard applet for users that need to easily switch between different layouts. All indicator applets are now consistent with each other (left clickable) and Raven launches appropriately when the notification applet is clicked. We have also included the super new volume applet that was developed after the main 10.2.7 release.\n\n[![budgie_release](images/budgie_release.png)](https://github.com/solus-project/budgie-desktop/releases/tag/v10.2.7)\n\nOther issues that were fixed are:\n\n- A one-pixel line where the wallpaper would be visible when a program is maximized in multi-monitor setups has been resolved.\n- Budgie Menu gained a new option to let you open categories by rolling over them. This option is disabled by default, however one can enable it via the Roll-over mouse  option in the Budgie Menu applet settings.  Let us know your thoughts and if we should make this a default option.\n- Chrome apps should now be pinnable.\n- Fixed a crash in the workspaces applet for GTK 3.20.\n- Fixed the dreaded panel-applet-sort issue where sometimes one could see random sorting of the last couple applets on the panel.\n- End Session dialogs will now provide context-specific description and actions, such as Cancel and Logout on a Logout dialog.\n- Pin to Panel for items in the Icon Tasklist are now translatable.\n- Run Dialog will now quit after losing focus.\n\nTo find out more, visit [Solus OS release info](https://solus-project.com/2016/09/10/budgie-10-2-7-released/) page.\n\nAnother thing that most of our users reported is the Moka icon theme compatibility with the desktop itself and the GTK+3.22 apps available in 16.10. This release fixes a lot of different issues with icons.\n\n[![join_us](images/join_us.png)](https://budgie-remix.org/opportunities/)\n\n#### **[POCILLO ICON THEME](https://github.com/budgie-remix/pocillo)** IS COMING !\n\nThis is one of the things that we had a lot of discussion about and why it is needed. While there are a lot other distros that use different icon themes, we feel that budgie-remix needs to be unique and have its own style to differentiate it from other linux distros. For 16.10, Pocillo file and folder icons blend in seamlessly with the gorgeous Arc theme. We’ll be expanding the icon theme in the near future to improve consistency with Moka and Arc.\n\n![1610pic2](images/1610pic2.png)\n\nEvery package has been redone, checked and verified by Debian and Ubuntu developers; all of the obsolete packages have been removed so that there is no more unnecessary bloat slowing down your system. Most of these packages are also available to download from Debian and Ubuntu repositories.\n\n![goodies](images/goodies.jpg)\n\nSince this release is built upon the superb 16.10 foundations look out for the new linux 4.8.2 kernel as well as the various brand-new GTK+3.22 apps.\n\nWith this release, we’re moving forward to unifying Budgie DE experience with Ubuntu as a seamless desktop experience for both the new users and Linux veterans.\n\n* * *\n\nAny issues please raise on our [bug-tracker](https://bugs.launchpad.net/budgie-remix).  Drop-by our community [chat room](https://gitter.im/budgie-remix/community) to discuss your thoughts as well.","src/content/blog/2016/09/budgie-remix-16-10-beta-2-is-now-available.md",[219,220,221,222,223],"images/download_now.png","images/budgie_release.png","images/join_us.png","images/1610pic2.png","images/goodies.jpg","303fb0aa1090905a",{"html":226,"metadata":227},"\u003Cp>Howdy, budgie-remix users!

Most of the bugs have been resolved, but if you encounter any new one, feel free to report it back.  Please spread the good news!\n\n![16.04.1](images/16-04-1.png)\n\n \n\n#### BUDGIE WELCOME APP\n\nLook out for the new **Budgie Welcome** app – it’s in your _System Tools_ menu group.\n\nLots of updates have been made available since the 16.04.1 iso. For eg, panel resets is straightforward:\n\n\u003Ciframe class=\"youtube-player\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/fJrf41uy_N0?version=3&amp;rel=0&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent&amp;theme=light\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" data-height=\"720\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\">\u003C/iframe>\n\nPreviewing in the latest updates – switch your desktop from the clean and simple Arc theme to a gorgeous Material theme and icons. More on that in the next newsletter.\n\n#### NEW IMPROVEMENTS\n\nWe’ve updated the `budgie-screenshot-applet which should work better than the previous version. We've also updated the Budgie desktop environment package, adding in a few recommendations.`\n\n- `nautilus-share`: this makes samba sharing using GNOME Files file manager a snip\n- `policy-desktop-privileges`: you should notice a few areas where previously you needed to use `sudo` you no longer have to.\n- `ppa-purge`: a must for those using PPAs - allows you to remove and rollback PPA's easily\n- `gnome-system-monitor`: visual tool to help find out what is apps and processes are running.\n- `bash-completion`: must have package for those that use terminals alot\n- `thermald`: for newer Sandy Bridge based and later laptops your laptop should run much cooler now\n- `acpi-support`: support for various wireless scripts and hardware\n- `gvfs-fuse`: GNOME's virtual filesystem - various GNOME apps recognize and mounts filesystems automatically now\n\nDue to GTK 3.20 not landing soon enough for updating the themes and testing it, we regret to inform you the budgie-remix 16.10 ISO release will be delayed a little.\n\n#### TUTORIALS\n\nCheckout a couple of fascinating tutorials from our team member [Udara Madubhshana](https://plus.google.com/+UdaraMadubhashana):\n\n[![](images/conky_tut.jpg)](https://plus.google.com/communities/106822666079268690759)\n\n[![](images/VirtualBox_Yakety2BYak_24_07_2016_12_05_12.png)](https://plus.google.com/communities/106822666079268690759)\n\n### UPCOMING NEW WEBSITE\n\nThe new budgie-remix website is ready for its debut in the following days.

ALPHA\n\nWe put together our 16.10 alpha – many thanks for all our testers.  The feedback has been valuable.\n\n![thanks](images/thanks.jpg)\n\n#### ALPHA TO BETA CHANGES:\n\n![alpha_to_beta](images/alpha_to_beta.png)\n\n- Networking has been fixed – we now use the new Canonical Netplan configuration\n- Debian Wallpapers has been removed\n- The ISO can now be installed in all locales offered by the installer\n- The ISO comes with English, German, French, Spanish and Portuguese for fast installation.  All other locales and languages are downloaded if required\n- The 16.10 Community Contest wallpapers have been included.\n- Plymouth now correctly displays “budgie-remix”\n- The ISO can now be installed via Ubuntu USB Creator\n- budgie-welcome has been updated to 0.3.10\n- budgie-welcome now launches the Ubuntu Installer when in “live-dvd/USB” mode\n- Rhythmbox defaults to the Arc dark theme – just gorgeous!\n- The spurious gnome-shell session available via the login screen has been removed.\n\n#### DEVELOPMENT\n\nUnfortunately we have decided to drop (at least for 16.10) our change to a new greeter.  This is due to serious upstream issues affecting Debian and Ubuntu that have now (as yet) not been resolved.\n\nWe are pleased that more of the [budgie-remix packages](http://packages.ubuntu.com/search?keywords=budgie&searchon=names&suite=yakkety&section=all) have now been made available directly from the Ubuntu Universe Repos.  We are nearly there with our aim to get all of the budgie-remix packages into the Ubuntu repositories – a prerequisite for our Official Community Flavour Status application to be considered by the Ubuntu Technical Board.\n\n![building](images/building.jpg)\n\n#### FUTURE PLANS\n\nWe are exploring creating a new icon-theme that blends Moka with Arc themed icons – more news on this in the future hopefully … but to give you a flavour – a few Arc-coloured icons from various icon-themes and what we are currently considering for the Files folder icon.\n\n![icons.png](images/icons.png)\n\n#### SHUSH … SECRET

Please note - there is no direct upgrade path from 24.04.2 to 25.04; you must uplift to 24.10 first or perform a fresh install.\n\nIn these release notes the areas covered are:\n\n- New features and enhancements released since 24.10\n- Upgrading from 24.10 Ubuntu Budgie\n- Fixed Issues\n- Known Issues when upgrading\n- Support arrangements for our distro\n- Where to download Ubuntu Budgie\n\n## New Features and Enhancements\nThe key focus for the team for this cycle has been the conversion of our distro to a Wayland based distro. We have been working closely with our fellow Buddies Of Budgie maintainers.\n\nExcellent progress has been made towards this huge effort – we are almost there and we will be making available a 25.04 PPA specifically for our fantastic community to try and feedback.  We will be shortly announcing the when-how-why in a dedicated blog post.\n\nNote - we intend to ship v10.10 of budgie-desktop as a stable release for 25.10; this will be wayland only. For 25.04 budgie-desktop is Xorg-server based and this PPA will give 25.04 users an easy way to try and give feedback - help fix issues etc.\n\nWe are no longer including Thunderbird as part of our default application set.  With many users now using webmail we have decided the choice of email clients should rightly be put into our community hands - see later for the email ballot.\n\nWe now ship with bibata cursors as an option.  We feel these are a great fit for our distro - just choose a bibata variant via budgie-desktop-settings.\n\n## Applets and mini-apps\nLots of updated translations from our brilliant translators https://www.transifex.com/ubuntu-budgie/\nOur budgie menu applet has now the ability to show terminal based applications in the menu thanks to a pull request from a new developer Sarah Leibbrand.\n\nShow-time now correctly displays across monitors thanks to a PR from Danny Trunk.\n\nThe latest budgie-desktop v10.9.2 together with a number of fixes to resolve crashes due to the 25.04 repository archive changes forms the basis of our Plucky offering. \n\n## Other Improvements and Bug Fixes\nThis image showcases the change of default terminal app to xfce terminal for Ubuntu Budgie.\n\nOur default theme Pocillo has had a tidy-up thanks to new team member Kyuyrii. Likewise the Qogir theme has been updated utilising all the good work by Vinceliuice\nOur snap based version of Pocillo has also been updated by Kyuyrii as well together with our QogirBudgie snap theme.\n\nWe have a new snap for the icon-theme as well which will be shortly going through the approval process to allow autoconnections to other snaps.\n\nThe default wallpaper choice has been uplifted for Plucky.\n\nOur welcome app is automatically updated for all 24.04 and 24.10 users\n\nBudgie welcome now has its plucky configuration.\n\nWe now include an email ballot page - accessible via Getting Started as well as on first login after installation.  Here you can choose to install evolution, geary, kontact, astroid, claws as well as the thunderbird snap.\n\n## Areas to look out for\nThe Ubuntu release notes are to be found [here](https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/plucky-puffin-release-notes/48687)\n\n## Packaging Updates\nWhilst not immediately obvious, various packages that we maintain need to be updated for a number of reasons, so this section lists what updates have been made.\n\n - gnome-online-accounts-gtk - this is the very latest upstream version\n - lightdm-settings\n - slick-greeter.\n \nTeam member Sam has been busy packaging and testing the following for noble, oracular & plucky!\n\n - colloid-icon-theme\n - fluent-icon-theme\n - nemo-terminal\n - orchis-gtk-theme\n - tela-circle-icon-theme\n - vimix-gtk-themes\n - whitesur-icon-theme\n - colloid-gtk-theme\n - mojave-gtk-theme\n - fluent-gtk-theme\n - whitesur-gtk-theme\n\nWe also now maintain a brand-new app called waycheck - a must for all new & existing wayland developer to see what wayland protocols are supported by your choice of wayland compositor.  Do check it out.\n\n## How to install\n\nIt is important to keep in mind a few useful tips before attempting a release upgrade:\n\nIMPORTANT: remember to double-check you have the following vital package before you upgrade:\n\n    sudo apt install ubuntu-budgie-desktop\n\n- Backup your data.\n- Install all available updates and reboot.\n- It is always a good idea to run either a full system snapshot with Timeshift, to a secondary drive, or a full system image using Clonezilla.\n- If you have PPAs that come with updated kernel, mesa, GPU drivers, it is better to purge those PPAs and reboot before attempting release upgrade.\n- Once release upgrade starts, all your PPAs will be disabled. If you rely on important software from PPAs, it is better to manually check if those are updated for upcoming release of Ubuntu.\n- After upgrade is completed, remember to go to software sources, change release name on your PPAs, enable them and refresh package cache.\n\n### Scheduled upgrade from 24.04 LTS\nUsers of Ubuntu Budgie 24.04 LTS will not be prompted to upgrade to 25.04.\n\n### Scheduled upgrade from 24.10\nUsers of Ubuntu Budgie 24.10 will be prompted to upgrade to 25.04 a few days/weeks after the initial release.  Please be patient - Canonical only makes the switch once all the final blockers have been resolved.\n\nPlease refer to the community wiki for more help:\n\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/Upgrades\n\nAlso, Ask Ubuntu has an excellent guide to help you upgrade:\n\nhttp://askubuntu.com/questions/110477/how-do-i-upgrade-to-a-newer-version-of-ubuntu\n\nWe recommend that you install Ubuntu Budgie on hardware – suggested configuration is 4GB or more RAM and a newer than 10 year computer with 40GB disk space or more. UB can be installed in a virtual machine; we recommend you use 3D host graphics with 128Mb virtual graphics memory and 4GB RAM or more plus 40GB virtual disk space. Running with defaults on most virtualisation systems often results in a broken experience with crashes when launching budgie-control-center, applications such as Microsoft Edge failing to run because of the lack of a graphics card, choppy youtube experience etc.\n\n## On-going support\nAs an official community flavour we will be supporting the distro for nine months. This support includes releasing important stability issues as well as critical security fixes directly affecting our distro.\n\nBudgie packages are primarily in the Universe repository where the community help maintain this software.\n\nCommunity Support is available via our discourse forum. Ask Ubuntu and Ubuntu forums can and should also be used for all Ubuntu matters – all flavours are Ubuntu!\n\n## Final Release\nLinks to download final releases, as well as installation instructions, will be available on our Ubuntu Budgie website once Final Release is built: https://ubuntubudgie.org/downloads/.\n\n## Known Issues\n\n1. Setting/changing the session language.  We noticed that Menu - Language Support sometimes doesn't actually set the language for the session.  The current workaround is as follows. In a terminal run\n\n        localectl list-locales\n\n for your chosen language type\n\n        localectl set-locale LANG=locale.UTF-8\n\t\n  for example\n\n        localectl set-locale LANG=es_ES.UTF-8\n\t\n  Reboot\n\n2. On first install and logon, using budgie-welcome to access web-based installs such as Chrome will open gedit not firefox. The workaround is to launch firefox first. Logout and login and open Budgie Welcome again\n\n## Infrastructure Sponsors\nWe just wanted to thank our infrastructure sponsors who help us keep the lights on.\n\n### Digital Ocean\nOn a mission to simplify cloud computing so developers and their teams can spend more time building software that changes the world.\n\n### Discourse\nDiscourse is the 100% open source discussion platform built for the next decade of the Internet. Use it as a mailing list, discussion forum, long-form chat room, and more!","src/content/blog/ubuntu-release.md","582ec703708c6fb9",{"html":432,"metadata":433},"\u003Cp>These release notes showcase the key takeaways for 24.10 upgraders to 25.04.

Starting from 17.04 we will be using Ubuntu Budgie name, while older releases will keep the budgie-remix name in accordance with Ubuntu rules. At the moment, we're currently updating a lot of stuff to prepare for first official release.\n\n17.04 is turning out to be an exiting release - upstream kernel brings much needed AMD graphics changes, GCC 7 compiler changes = speed increases ... all in all an exciting snappier release.\n\n### Team News\n\nUdara has taken a break to deal with urgent issues. We thank him very much for all of his hard work! Thus we definitely need to fill his considerable 'shoes'.**we need a graphics designer/artist** The Ubuntu Budgie team are on the look out for a new member of the team as a graphics designer/artist. The person needs to be be enthusiastic who loves to integrate and create innovative artwork at fairly short notice to fit and target single or multiple platforms - websites/newsletters/application artwork etc. Interested? Go-on - its a great open-source opportunity! Contact us through our websites [https://ubuntubudgie.org/contact](https://ubuntubudgie.org/contact) and [https://budgie-remix.org/support-us/](https://budgie-remix.org/support-us/) or come and have a chat in our community chat room - [https://gitter.im/ubuntubudgie/community](https://gitter.im/ubuntubudgie/community)\n\n### New Website - ubuntubudgie.org\n\nAs you already noticed, we've updated our new ubuntubudgie.org website, making it faster and easier to use on variety of devices. Want to download Ubuntu Budgie from phone? You can! No more fighting with website when visiting various pages or posts. The website is fully responsive which results in better expereince for every user. If you encounter any bugs, or something weird, slow loading etc. please feel free to report it to us, so that we can fix it and provide awesome browsing experience for our users.\n\nOnce finished we'll be repointing budgie-remix.org to our new website URL.\n\n### Budgie-Desktop v10.2.9\n\nYou should have all received upstream's very latest maintenance release of budgie-desktop. According to the [release notes](https://solus-project.com/2016/12/16/budgie-10-2-9-released/) , all efforts will now be expended on the v11 release. We don't know the date but expect exciting news earlier rather than later next year!\n\n10.2.9 has been sent to Debian for their consideration - once the review cycle has completed it will automatically appear in Ubuntu 17.04\n\n### Development\n\nApplication indicator has been improved most of the issues that were posted on the GitHub have been fixed. It looks and works better in both 16.04 and 16.10. Applet color settings are now respected, whether you choose inbuilt theme with and without styling region, or if you are using another theme. AppIndicator Applet is now available in Debian and Zesty as well.\n\nCurrently, we're working hard on next release, which will have a lot of different updates and fixes. We have successfully updated package names in Zesty from budgie-remix to Ubuntu Budgie. We've also been sponsored to upload our ubuntu-budgie-meta package which will allow us to produce ISO's. Also, we've added some changes to Ubiquity slideshow and how it functions overall. A Pull request has been done for Canonical ISO builder - this has been accepted; this is the very last step - once Canonical devs push the \"button\" we will see automatically generate daily Ubuntu Budgie ISO's for 17.04.\n\nWe've backported a patch from xenial to yakkety users which should result in budgie-desktop stability and far fewer crashes when installing or updating. The good news is that upstream are working hard with budgie v11 and a brand new menu system which will finally fix all the not-so-nice menu crash issues budgie-desktop currently has when running in Ubuntu.\n\nHave a look at budgie-welcome - new is the beginnings of our browser ballot screen - you choose at the push of a button what browser you want. Eventually we will include out-of-tree browsers like Chrome and Vivaldi.\n\n \n\n![Drawing](images/fresh-logo-nav.png)\n\nFinally - in [preview testing](https://sourceforge.net/projects/budgie-remix/files/budgie-remix%20fresh%2016.10/)  - is a remix of our remix! We will call this \"budgie-remix fresh\" and it is our ultimate hacker's distro. A totally minimal package free install allowing you to customise everything about your installation. Out of the box 64bit weighs in at less than 220MB RAM usage. 32bit is less than 190MB! You are in control ... we are certainly very interested in your creations - so let us know what you have created based on the fabulous budgie-desktop. We intend to finalise this during the 17.04 cycle so we'll have two ISO's - a minimal fresh edition and the exciting new official release.","src/content/blog/2016/12/december-news-update.md",[525],"images/fresh-logo-nav.png","ffb2ae8f94d67471",{"html":528,"metadata":529},"\u003Cp>Hey everyone, it has been a little while since our last post so here are some latest news on what’s happening\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"official-status\">Official Status\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>As you already know, we’ve acquired official status, marking another milestone in our distro development.

Back then the official site for the Budgie Remix (The name of Ubuntu Budgie, before it became official flavour) was run on WordPress.com. (WordPress.com is the Automattic hosted version of WordPress) The good thing was that most of the team was familiar with it, which at that time I've used for 9 years, so there was no problem in getting used to the platform with self-hosted version.\n\nThe first logical thing to do was to switch to the self-hosted version of WordPress so that we could have more control and customization options. I started working new Ubuntu Budgie website, but at the same time I was thinking on how much WordPress is good option. Now don't get me wrong, WordPress it pretty powerful blogging system which you can extend with plugins and themes to make anything you want from simple blog to shop or support website. At that time I thought it was an overkill to use WordPress as CMS, since I wanted to make the website simple and lightweight as much as possible.\n\nDuring some time last year before I joined Ubuntu Budgie, while browsing some web development blogs, I noticed that one of the editors was talking about new CMS called Pagekit, that he recently tested. While reading his post, I wanted to try it myself and test it. I went to their website and download 0.x version which at that time was the latest release. The first thing that impressed me was the inclusion of http server within the application that you could access via CLI. My usual testing routine is to test the new web apps via XAMPP or Vagrant. While reading the requirements page on Pagekit website, I noticed that it also could use SQLite. The installation was simple as extracting the zipped file to its own folder, going to the folder and invoking `./pagekit start --server=127.0.0.1:8080` to start builtin http server. There are also other options which you can find by executing `./pagekit help`. You can even do the whole installation, upgrade and plugin removal via CLI.\n\nInstallation was a breeze after which I got welcomed by Pagekit dashboard. Pagekit dashboard is built from different widgets which allows you to make it your own by personalizing in a similar way to WordPress.\n\n![Dashboard](images/Clipboard01.jpg)\n\nUpload manager is one of the best I've seen in modern day CMS. As simple as it is, it also does what is made for without any problem.\n\nPlugin and Theme pages are simple and clean. You can download new themes or plugins via Marketplace which you can find from Dropdown menu.\n\nThe editor is simply amazing. You have an option to use either pure HTML or Markdown. The most interesting thing about it? You can actually go full screen to the distraction mode and have Work/Preview section side by side as you type. If you aren't fan of Markdown you can install WYSIWYG editor and write the content as you are used to in other CMS.\n\n![Editor](images/write.jpg)\n\nUser Management comes with integrated permission system so that you can manage what your users can do on each part of the website. Making custom roles is easy as well as asigning different permissions that aren't tied to the default roles.\n\nThe blog itself is an extension which you can activate if you want to extend your website with blog like this one :)\n\nIn June, I presented the beta version of the website to David, the project leader, and other team members, which gave their feedback about the website and approval to continue working on it. During the beta testing, other team members got used to Pagekit which didn't have a much of a learning curve like for example Drupal. The usage of UIKit CSS Framework was an awesome addition to the PageKit.\n\nComposer and Gulp seemed tedious at first, but once you start using them, you wonder how could you work without them.\n\nPagekit uses Symfony PHP framework which makes code a lot cleaner and easy to use and extend. Another good side of using Symfony is that there are no dependencies on older code for compatibility, which makes it blazing fast when coupled with PHP 7 and Caching plugins. According to Gmetrix the Fully Loaded Time is 1.7s while Total Page Size is 562KB with file caching. You can go even lower if you start using server caching plugins.\n\nLast week, marked the official exit from beta stage and going live with new website. During 13th and 14th of April we received around 20.0000+ users according to out Analytics page. At one point, we had to scale Digital Ocean's droplet on which we are currently hosting website, to serve the number of incoming users.\n\nThe theme we've adapted is called Brick which you can find from Marketplace.\n\nIt would be interesting to see some new features integrated in the core like post/page revisions and some backup solutions.\n\nOverall, we're satisfied with PageKit and we want to thank the developers for making it. We know how hard it is to work on young project first hand and at the same time we wanted to bet on it as some people bet on us and tried using our Distribution instead of already established ones.

At the same time you will be helping us earn some much needed revenue needed to keep the project running and growing. The store is now available [https://www.zazzle.com/s/ubuntu+budgie](https://www.zazzle.com/s/ubuntu+budgie) - there is great stuff to choose from. We'll be including this in budgie-welcome and our website soon.\n\nDustin has been working to create a link to the store via our website and budgie-welcome as well. We'll add an updated budgie-welcome to 16.04/16.10 and 17.04 backports as soon as its ready.\n\nUdara has also been working on some designs for Ubuntu Budgie swag. Looking forward to seeing these.\n\n## Making things better...\n\nLots of fixups have been made to Ubuntu Budgie 17.10 to accommodate Terminix changing its name to Tilix. Also, now have the ability to search in the menu for all Settings control panel icons. The odd uxterm and xterm menu items has gone, as has the guest session from the login greeter - it didnt work anyway - N.B. if anyone can figure out why you cannot login to the guest session please let me know.\n\nVideo thumbnails now appear in Files (Nautilus) without needing GNOME Videos (Totem) installed - yay!\n\nThese fixes and enhancements have been uploaded to Artful.\n\nI have been listening to issues raised via our gitter chatroom. Chief amongst them was that some people did not want plank installed - for 17.04 deinstalling plank would also remove some critical Ubuntu Budgie packages. This has now been resolved in 17.10. Top Tip - to stop plank running - just open \"Start Up applications\" and untick plank.\n\n![Workspace%201 029](images/Workspace201_029.jpg)\n\nDropbox has been a real pain in the past - it is proprietary software and has only worked on Unity (it is hardcoded in the binary). Fortunately I have used a workaround to fool Dropbox to think it is running in Unity. This fix has been accepted into Artful. I've backported this to 17.04 users - just upgrade with backports enabled.\n\nHEXCube has resolved now the annoying issue with not being able (easily) to enter the crypt password for a full-disk encrypted installation. It boiled down to our switch to \"ubuntu budgie\" name - the plymouth theme and the theme components needed to be identical. So with a careful bit of renaming crypt password entry is now possible ... and as a side effect, the plymouth theme applies all the way through to the login screen. This has been uploaded to Artful.\n\nIn April I worked on gathering together upstream fixes from the v10.3 budgie-desktop and applied this to 17.04 budgie-desktop 10.2.9 as a stable-release update. This has been accepted, tested and released.\n\n- Bottom panel popups - hopefully for most setups, the popup \"drop from top to bottom\" issue has been resolved\n- Notification icon no longer turns red when first logon and network is connected.\n- ALT+F2 run-dialog box is correctly sized\n\nA few people have had issues with removing packages and accidentally uninstalling the key package budgie-desktop-environment. I have pushed a change available in backports to prevent this happening.\n\n## New Development\n\nI have spent lots of time working with Konstantin on his [global appmenu project](https://github.com/rilian-la-te/vala-panel-appmenu) . I resolved budgie-desktop showing the global menu in a transparent colour, lots of debian packaging issues, MATE issues and freezes. Test PPA is available for 16.04, 16.10 and 17.04 - ppa:ubuntubudgie-dev/global-menu-test. Ubuntu MATE are interested in this project as well and it may well find its way into the 17.10 repositories. We'll keep you informed if this happens.\n\n![Globalmenu](images/globalmenu.jpg)\n\nI have been looking at slick-greeter the forked Unity Greeter by Linux Mint. This is a gorgeous HiDPI capable greeter and is completely distro agnostic unlike the Unity greeter Have been working with Linux Mint devs to resolve some issues. Also, in record time, have submitted the package to Debian - accepted and is now in 17.10 repositories.\n\nThe new greeter will make its debut in Ubuntu Budgie for 17.10 and is now available in our 17.10 dailies.\n\n![Workspace%201 031](images/Workspace201_031.jpg)\n\nI have reworked Budgie Welcome - Default Settings page themes. This now correctly works with all budgie-remix/Ubuntu Budgie versions. I have uplifted it to the very latest bootstrap version. Works faster now with subtle but better animations.\n\nThemes now have a lightbox display enabling you to enlarge the theme picture. For 16.04 users we have dropped Vimix - upstream changes have broken this theme. Exclusively for 16.04 users - Vertex is now available to be applied through this screen. Also, Ceti-2 is a brand new theme package now available and installable through budgie-welcome. Also have packaged up the theme Flat-plat. We are just evaluating this and if its a good fit we'll make it available as an install. More news later on this.\n\nHave tidied the budgie-desktop v10.3 packaging and submitted to Debian for evaluation. Once accepted this will make its way into the 17.10 repositories.\n\nUdara has been created a nice bit of material design wallpaper artwork - this will debut in 17.10. Additionally Udara has created a banner for our upcoming 17.10 wallpaper contest. So fair warning - get those fantastic unique photos ready - contest will be announced in June.\n\n![Artful wallpaper contest](images/artful-wallpaper-contest.jpg)\n\nNiyas has been added a few tidyups to Budgie Welcome. Some preliminary work as been added (but not yet activated) that will enable the whole interface (layout/themes/fonts) to be switched. We have plans for the ability to switch between Ubuntu Budgie look and feel, Classic Budgie, MacOS type switch, MATE type look and feel and a Unity makeover.

Also, now have the ability to search in the menu for all Settings control panel icons. The odd uxterm and xterm menu items has gone, as has the guest session from the login greeter - it didnt work anyway - N.B. if anyone can figure out why you cannot login to the guest session please let me know.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Video thumbnails now appear in Files (Nautilus) without needing GNOME Videos (Totem) installed - yay!\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>These fixes and enhancements have been uploaded to Artful.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I have been listening to issues raised via our gitter chatroom. Chief amongst them was that some people did not want plank installed - for 17.04 deinstalling plank would also remove some critical Ubuntu Budgie packages. This has now been resolved in 17.10.

I’ve backported this to 17.04 users - just upgrade with backports enabled.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>HEXCube has resolved now the annoying issue with not being able (easily) to enter the crypt password for a full-disk encrypted installation. It boiled down to our switch to “ubuntu budgie” name - the plymouth theme and the theme components needed to be identical. So with a careful bit of renaming crypt password entry is now possible … and as a side effect, the plymouth theme applies all the way through to the login screen. This has been uploaded to Artful.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>In April I worked on gathering together upstream fixes from the v10.3 budgie-desktop and applied this to 17.04 budgie-desktop 10.2.9 as a stable-release update.

Also, Ceti-2 is a brand new theme package now available and installable through budgie-welcome. Also have packaged up the theme Flat-plat.

So please check it out and get some great Ubuntu Budgie merchandise.\n\n## Fixups\n\nBudgie Welcome theming has received a few updates. Vertex theme for 16.04 users now installs the correct Vertex Iconset. The screenshots for the 16.10/17.04 themes have been updated by Niyas to accurately show the themes and icons that would be applied if you installed them. The 16.04 screenshots similarly needs some help - please volunteer!\n\nBudgie Welcome has an issue with reinstalling the same PPA even if its already enabled together with a full update. This has been resolved. Package installation should be faster now.\n\nBit of an oops moment with budgie-welcome and our Italian translation - the app couldnt be started for our Italian friends. So fixed that in a matter of a few minutes and released it immediately.\n\n## New Development\n\nPleased to add [Flat-Plat](https://github.com/nana-4/Flat-Plat)  with [Numix Icons (Circle)](https://github.com/numixproject/numix-icon-theme)  as a new default theme that can be applied via Budgie Welcome. Simply gorgeous - well worth checking this out.\n\nEvoPop was the default theme from the very early days of budgie-desktop. It fell into disuse due to newer GTK+ versions and changes to budgie-desktop. Thankfully a new version has been released that is compatible with 17.04 and later and I have added this to budgie-welcome. You can try this now by installing the evopop-gtk-theme package\n\n16.04/16.10 and 17.04 (backports) will have received Udara's fabulous material design wallpaper. This will debut in 17.10 by default. All material design theme makeovers (budgie-welcome - Default Settings) now apply this.\n\nBudgie Welcome has now been updated with our Online Shop. Please check it out - anything you purchase, a small proportion of the proceeds goes towards Ubuntu Budgie enabling the project to grow.\n\n![Budgie%20Welcome 046](images/Budgie20Welcome_046.jpg)\n\nPleased to see Budgie Welcome (mostly) translated into Italian and Portuguese (Brazillian). Fantastic job by our southern european and south american friends. Given the new online shop we need more help translating this area and to finish off existing translations - [https://www.transifex.com/ubuntu-budgie/budgie-welcome/](https://www.transifex.com/ubuntu-budgie/budgie-welcome/) Where translators and translations are relatively complete, this month I have kept up-to-date through several timely updates.\n\nThe default settings page in budgie-welcome has been now split into two tabs to ease navigation - default is themes - the second tab for general settings i.e. panel reset. Really looks nice now and less cluttered.\n\nFrom the front-screen of budgie-welcome you can now easily navigate to see Flatpak and Snap Apps. In addition we have gathered what we consider the best maintained budgie-applets together for easy installation.\n\nNew applets that have been packaged and are now available in 16.04 and 17.10 include:\n\n- [budgie-calendar](https://github.com/danielpinto8zz6/budgie-calendar-applet)  - an alternative clock for the panel but when clicked, the calendar is displayed in a popover\n- [budgie-haste-applet](https://github.com/cybre/budgie-haste-applet)  - publish text and prose to a variety of online sources\n- [budgie-brightness-control](https://github.com/ilgarmehmetali/budgie-brightness-control-applet)  - control the brightness of your desktop via an easy to use graphical slider\n- [budgie-screenshot-applet](https://github.com/cybre/budgie-screenshot-applet)  - take screenshots of your desktop/windows or selections and easily publish these to imgur.com etc.\n- [budgie-pixel-saver-applet](https://github.com/ilgarmehmetali/budgie-pixel-saver-applet)  - move maximized (non CSD) window decorations into the panel saving vertical screenspace\n\nOMGUbuntu noticed our tweet and wrote an excellent [article](http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2017/06/5-awesome-budgie-desktop-applets)  - nice to see Ubuntu Budgie and budgie-welcome being mentioned.\n\nBudgie Welcome front-page software center button has now changed to a \"Install Software\" button. You now have links to the Flatpak and Snap online stores.\n\nIn addition I have added a stylish new \"Budgie Desktop Applet Store\" - basically a page with the best applets (IMHO) available today - just one-click to install.\n\nI have submitted changes to Linux Mint's slick-greeter project to fully document the various options available. Creating and editing /etc/lightdm/slick-greeter.conf is straightforward - just type \"man slick-greeter\" for the options that you can use - e.g. changing the background image. This has resulted in a new release and have uploaded this to Debian/Ubuntu 17.10.\n\n![Slick greeter](images/slick-greeter.jpg)\n\n17.10 changes include dropping Eye of GNOME from the default install. The image-viewer will now be gThumb. Don't forget Sushi is available (press space-bar on pictures etc in File) to preview file-content.\n\nWe have included the brilliant folder-color package - you can now change Files folder icon colors or change folders to include emblems.\n\nMore requested Files changes - you can now right-click in Files to create new template files and images. Yeah - I have been listening! This will be uploaded soon to 17.10\n\n## Insights\n\nTo give you an idea of what needs to happen when updating a software package here is a little story. It all begins with wanting to update the Ubuntu repositories with the latest version of budgie-desktop (v10.3.1)...\n\nFor 16.04/16.10 users the process is \"straightforward\" - rework the package and upload to the budgie-remix PPA. Similarly for 17.04 folk - send the package to Launchpad to be built and uploaded to the backports PPA.\n\nTo upload to the Artful (17.10) repositories I need to cleanup and fixup all possible packaging issues and upload to Debian Mentors. Mentors is a process where developers can assess the quality of your work - you usually go around a few cycles getting the packaging in tip-top condition. Then you have to find a sponsor that have the necessary rights can upload to Debian. The upload was the first hurdle (I already have a nice sponsor!) The Debian build system mysteriously failed to build the software - whereas the same code could be built manually and obviously can be built into a Ubuntu PPA. After a few weeks of trying, one of the GNOME Twitch developers/packages pointed me to a possible tweak that is specific to Debian. Bingo!\n\nMy Debian Sponsor also has the rights to synchronise from Debian to Ubuntu ... and then the Ubuntu build system crashed and burned budgie-desktop.\n\nAfter much scratching of heads this came down to the Artful build system automatically builds from Proposed packages ... and in amongst those packages was a package critical for budgie-desktop that had lots of regressions (bugs!). The budgie-desktop build failure was eventually tracked down in Meson package. Jeremy Bicha thankfully pull together the fixes from upstream and now 10.3.1 has landed in Arful.\n\nSo there you have it ... its not simple to update software. No wonder my hair is going grey!\n\n## Random Stuff\n\nDustin is applying to Ubuntu Membership - something that I would warmly recommend to all commited Ubuntu users. Give Dustin your endorsement via a testamonial [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/bashfulrobot](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/bashfulrobot)\n\nBoth Dustin and myself have been playing with snaps and snapcraft. Snaps are a promising means of delivering software to everyone in a timely manner. For example, we could snap budgie-welcome. Making changes in our GitHub repo will be built automatically and delivered to everyone almost immediately.\n\nPlans by upstream could include allowing snaps as part of the ISO. Some more work to allow file-system overlays is required to enable snaps of applets and other stuff that is file-system specific - but again this is planned work.\n\n**We now say bye-bye to 16.10**. It has virtually reached its end-of-life and will no longer be receiving anymore security updates shortly nor will we be updating any software. This is standard practise for all Ubuntu flavors for an EOL distro. We strongly encourage you to upgrade to 17.04 if you haven't already.\n\nIkey Doherty and Stefan Ric has been hacking away with budgie-desktop fixups. Brilliant news is that they have completely reworked all the GTK Popup code and as a result the bottom panel animation issues have been resolved. As a massive bonus, left and right panels are now possible. Ikey similarly has brought Mate-Desktop brisk-menu search capabilities to budgie-desktop. Sorting and searching really does work brilliantly now. Kudos to these two for all these changes.\n\nWhen these changes are released from upstream, there will be a delay before we bring this to 16.04 and 17.04 users since this work unfortunately breaks existing third-party applets. These need fixes first before we can bring the new version when it is released.\n\nDustin and myself were invited to have a chat with Rocco for [Destination Linux](http://destinationlinux.org/destination-linux-episode-25/) . Its was great fun - well worth a listen on your daily commute!\n\n![Rocco](images/rocco.jpg)\n\nI spent a bit of time this month packaging the [osx-arc-collection](https://github.com/LinxGem33/OSX-Arc-White)  of themes and icons. Disappointingly the maintainer has discontinued further development of budgie-desktop support. Anyone interested in taking these really nice themes forward?\n\nFinally - I shouldn't really say this ... but Vincenzo has been working on a really - really massive opportunity for both yourself and Ubuntu Budgie. We have an outline agreement and an exciting partner and just need to cross the t's and dot the i. nuff said - more about this in due course.\n\nDavid (project lead)","src/content/blog/2017/07/developer-diary-june.md",[769,343,914,915,916],"images/Budgie20Welcome_046.jpg","images/slick-greeter.jpg","images/rocco.jpg","a6e16327d41368ff",{"html":919,"metadata":920},"\u003Ch2 id=\"shoutout\">Shoutout\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>We have launched our 17.10 \u003Ca href=\"https://www.flickr.com/groups/ubuntubudgie1710\">desktop wallpaper competition\u003C/a>  - we really do need your fabulous photos and images so please take part … otherwise the team will find and use our own family pics … you have been warned ;)\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg __ASTRO_IMAGE_=\"{&#x22;src&#x22;:&#x22;images/artful-wallpaper-contest.jpg&#x22;,&#x22;alt&#x22;:&#x22;Artful wallpaper contest&#x22;,&#x22;index&#x22;:0}\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>We are very grateful to our small band of \u003Ca href=\"https://ubuntubudgie.org/admin/blog/post/@page/5\">Patreons and Paypal contributors this month\u003C/a> .

Simply gorgeous - well worth checking this out.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>EvoPop was the default theme from the very early days of budgie-desktop. It fell into disuse due to newer GTK+ versions and changes to budgie-desktop. Thankfully a new version has been released that is compatible with 17.04 and later and I have added this to budgie-welcome. You can try this now by installing the evopop-gtk-theme package\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>16.04/16.10 and 17.04 (backports) will have received Udara’s fabulous material design wallpaper. This will debut in 17.10 by default. All material design theme makeovers (budgie-welcome - Default Settings) now apply this.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Budgie Welcome has now been updated with our Online Shop.

You now have links to the Flatpak and Snap online stores.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>In addition I have added a stylish new “Budgie Desktop Applet Store” - basically a page with the best applets (IMHO) available today - just one-click to install.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I have submitted changes to Linux Mint’s slick-greeter project to fully document the various options available. Creating and editing /etc/lightdm/slick-greeter.conf is straightforward - just type “man slick-greeter” for the options that you can use - e.g. changing the background image.

Yeah - I have been listening! This will be uploaded soon to 17.10\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"insights\">Insights\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>To give you an idea of what needs to happen when updating a software package here is a little story. It all begins with wanting to update the Ubuntu repositories with the latest version of budgie-desktop (v10.3.1)…\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>For 16.04/16.10 users the process is “straightforward” - rework the package and upload to the budgie-remix PPA. Similarly for 17.04 folk - send the package to Launchpad to be built and uploaded to the backports PPA.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>To upload to the Artful (17.10) repositories I need to cleanup and fixup all possible packaging issues and upload to Debian Mentors. Mentors is a process where developers can assess the quality of your work - you usually go around a few cycles getting the packaging in tip-top condition. Then you have to find a sponsor that have the necessary rights can upload to Debian. The upload was the first hurdle (I already have a nice sponsor!) The Debian build system mysteriously failed to build the software - whereas the same code could be built manually and obviously can be built into a Ubuntu PPA. After a few weeks of trying, one of the GNOME Twitch developers/packages pointed me to a possible tweak that is specific to Debian. Bingo!\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>My Debian Sponsor also has the rights to synchronise from Debian to Ubuntu … and then the Ubuntu build system crashed and burned budgie-desktop.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>After much scratching of heads this came down to the Artful build system automatically builds from Proposed packages … and in amongst those packages was a package critical for budgie-desktop that had lots of regressions (bugs!). The budgie-desktop build failure was eventually tracked down in Meson package. Jeremy Bicha thankfully pull together the fixes from upstream and now 10.3.1 has landed in Arful.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So there you have it … its not simple to update software. No wonder my hair is going grey!\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"random-stuff\">Random Stuff\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Dustin is applying to Ubuntu Membership - something that I would warmly recommend to all commited Ubuntu users. Give Dustin your endorsement via a testamonial \u003Ca href=\"https://wiki.ubuntu.com/bashfulrobot\">https://wiki.ubuntu.com/bashfulrobot\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Both Dustin and myself have been playing with snaps and snapcraft. Snaps are a promising means of delivering software to everyone in a timely manner. For example, we could snap budgie-welcome. Making changes in our GitHub repo will be built automatically and delivered to everyone almost immediately.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Plans by upstream could include allowing snaps as part of the ISO. Some more work to allow file-system overlays is required to enable snaps of applets and other stuff that is file-system specific - but again this is planned work.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>We now say bye-bye to 16.10\u003C/strong>. It has virtually reached its end-of-life and will no longer be receiving anymore security updates shortly nor will we be updating any software. This is standard practise for all Ubuntu flavors for an EOL distro. We strongly encourage you to upgrade to 17.04 if you haven’t already.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Ikey Doherty and Stefan Ric has been hacking away with budgie-desktop fixups. Brilliant news is that they have completely reworked all the GTK Popup code and as a result the bottom panel animation issues have been resolved. As a massive bonus, left and right panels are now possible. Ikey similarly has brought Mate-Desktop brisk-menu search capabilities to budgie-desktop. Sorting and searching really does work brilliantly now. Kudos to these two for all these changes.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>When these changes are released from upstream, there will be a delay before we bring this to 16.04 and 17.04 users since this work unfortunately breaks existing third-party applets. These need fixes first before we can bring the new version when it is released.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Dustin and myself were invited to have a chat with Rocco for \u003Ca href=\"http://destinationlinux.org/destination-linux-episode-25/\">Destination Linux\u003C/a> . Its was great fun - well worth a listen on your daily commute!\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg __ASTRO_IMAGE_=\"{&#x22;src&#x22;:&#x22;images/rocco.jpg&#x22;,&#x22;alt&#x22;:&#x22;Rocco&#x22;,&#x22;index&#x22;:0}\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I spent a bit of time this month packaging the \u003Ca href=\"https://github.com/LinxGem33/OSX-Arc-White\">osx-arc-collection\u003C/a>  of themes and icons.

Cheers.\n\n# 17.10 Alpha 2\n\nWe spent lots of time this month preparing and testing for our first an only Alpha release of 17.10. Good news is that it is really stable especially so early in the development cycle.\n\n![Unnamed](images/unnamed.jpg)\n\nCheckout our [release note](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ArtfulAardvark/Alpha2/UbuntuBudgie)  for the current changes. Onwards towards Beta 1 at the beginning of September!\n\nWe have also launched our [testing tracker](https://ubuntubudgie.org/testing)  page. Remember to bookmark this if you are helping us testing the alpha and beta releases\n\n# Fixes\n\nThe website certificate was up for renewal and we missed the renewal date and time by a few hours. So apologies for that - you will have noticed that when visiting the website and your browser threw a wobbly saying the site was not safe to continue browsing. Dustin has done a whole bunch of remedial stuff and in future renewing the site certificate will be \"mellow\" - Dustin assures me.\n\nDustin has been doing a bit of backend work for the website to make maintainance easier going forward:\n\n- all domains in a central location\n- DDOS protection\n- access to additional advanced features if we grow and need them such as WAF (Web Application Firewall), Bypass Cache on Cookie, etc.\n- Global CDN\n- Can start small and grow as needed (pricing, scale, features)\n\nMozilla have now confirmed that they no longer support third party theming such as arc-firefox. Some of you may have noticed that recent versions of Firefox on 16.04/16.10 look slightly broken with the arc-firefox theme addon.\n\nThus, I have updated 16.04 and 16.10 to remove the arc-firefox addon. You should now have updated your systems. Firefox will default to the theming UI that Mozilla has decreed.\n\nI have spent some time looking at the lock screen. As you may know, setting the wallpaper for the lock screen via the Background dialog doesnt work. This is because gnome-screensaver precedes the modern Background dialog and doesnt understand here the background wallpaper is chosen. So I have pushed a fix for this. In addition, I have resurrected the old \"Unity\" lock screen look-and-feel before Unity switched its lock-screen in 16.04. So at least the lock-screen should look a little less 'bad' than it was. Hopefully Canonical devs will accept this.\n\nIn their mission to dump all things Unity and switch to GNOME Shell, the Ubuntu devs have managed to add package dependencies that have affected our distro. For those testing the early July dailies you will have noticed both Budgie Desktop and GNOME Shell is installed. A fix by the devs has fixed the immediate issue when UB is installed. So I have done a couple of fixes as well. The devs have accepted my fix to the ubiquity package. Remember this is all the fun of pre-alphas and alpha's. Don't install and keep running on machines. Keep regularly reinstalling to find this sort of issue and let us know when you encounter issues.\n\nI have tried to make the default settings page more discoverable by new users. This is where wholesale theme/fonts etc makeovers is peformed. The getting started wizard on first run now ends by running this page.\n\n![Workspace%201 067](images/Workspace201_067.jpg)\n\nThe terminal we use is Tilix. It was rather stuck on a relatively old version due to some Ubuntu patching issues. I took the opportunity to resolve some issues and the Ubuntu devs have accepted my patch. Good news - the latest stable Tilix version has found its way into 17.10.\n\n# New Development\n\nOur icon theme Pocillo has had a revamp with much better panel icons. Steam, caffeine, drop-box now work correctly and other icons looks and feel much more stylish. Joshua has been sorting out the Pocillo changes.\n\nThe Moka iconset which we also use has had a new release from upstream. This has now been packaged, uploaded into Debian and is now in the 17.10 dailies.\n\nI have been working with upstream ensuring that the new upcoming budgie desktop compiles on 16.04 and 17.04. Ikey has been very generous with resolving all the compilation issues - especially for 16.04 where the older Vala and GLib libraries was causing real havoc.\n\nUpstream have now defaulted to using sassc to compile the inbuilt budgie desktop theme; this is particulary problematic with 16.04 because it actually doesnt exist in the repositories nor have I found it in any third-party PPA.\n\nThus I have had to backport both libsass and sassc, ensure budgie desktop builds only with the latest recommended meson ... and created a ubuntu only patch to ensure our Debian package runs sassc - sassc + meson doesnt work with 16.04 GLib. All very technical - but at least now 16.04 users have a chance to run the upcoming budgie desktop.\n\nOne remaining issue remains - the new budgie-settings window throws some rather nasty looking errors and some parts of the new window looks broken. I haven't figured out how to resolve - so for the moment the 16.04 backport will unfortunately need to be put on hold until this is resolved.\n\n**It is important to note** - no release date has been given for the new budgie desktop. With the upcoming 17.10 freeze we may not be able to ship this latest desktop. We are ever hopeful.\n\n# Random Stuff\n\nI'm happy to announce a new member of the team. Jacob Vlijm hails from the Netherlands and is a brilliant developer with a strong python background. For those that visit askubuntu.com you will have seen Jacobs fantastic in-depth answers. He has a strong in-depth background in all things Ubuntu and will be a great asset to the team.\n\nTo kick things off he has been dusting off two of his Unity desktop projects to make them Ubuntu Budgie compatible. So check out his handy-work\n\n![Workspace%203 066](images/Workspace203_066.jpg)\n\nAn appindicator based and elegant workspace switcher:\n\n```\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:vlijm/wsindicator && sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install wsindicator\n```\n\nAlso you can have a separate wallpaper per workspace - this works for all budgie desktop distro users\n\n```\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:vlijm/wswitcher && sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install wswitcher\n```\n\nJacob possibly pulling these both under one package - maybe via a native budgie desktop applet. Stay tuned.\n\n16.04 Ubuntu and official flavours are releasing a point release on Thursday 3rd August. Whilst budgie-remix is not an official flavour, we are endevouring to follow Ubuntu and we will look to also release our 16.04.3 point release which incorporates all the changes released by ourselves and Ubuntu since last Februaries 16.04.2 release.

Magic!\n\n## Upgrading\n\n### How to upgrade from 17.04 to 17.10\n\n**IMPORTANT:** remember to double-check you have the following vital package before you upgrade:\n\n```\nsudo apt install ubuntu-budgie-desktop\n```\n\nAfter the release of 17.10, you will be offered to upgrade when you run Software & Updates.\n\nAlternatively, from a command line run:\n\n```\nupdate-manager\n```\n\nFor upgrading from the Final Beta:\n\n```\nupdate-manager -d\n```\n\nSome of the packages that were installed as part of the Ubuntu Budgie backports PPA (ppa:ubuntubudgie/backports) will be uninstalled as part of the upgrade. Use budgie-welcome to reinstall anything that is removed.\n\nIf you see the following issue:\n\n```\nErrors were encountered while processing:\n/tmp/apt-dpkg-install-I4K4cn/075-gir1.2-budgie-1.0_10.4-1ubuntu4_amd64.deb\nE: Sub-process /usr/bin/dpkg returned an error code (1)\nUnpacking gir1.2-budgie-1.0 (10.4-1ubuntu4) ...\ndpkg: error processing archive /var/cache/apt/archives/gir1.2-budgie-1.0_10.4-1ubuntu4_amd64.deb (--unpack):\ntrying to overwrite '/usr/lib/girepository-1.0/Budgie-1.0.typelib', which is also in package gir1.2-budgie-desktop-1.0 10.4-0ubuntu0.1\nErrors were encountered while processing:\n/var/cache/apt/archives/gir1.2-budgie-1.0_10.4-1ubuntu4_amd64.deb\nE: Sub-process /usr/bin/dpkg returned an error code (1)\n```\n\nRun the following:\n\n```\nsudo apt-get -o Dpkg::Options::=\"--force-overwrite\" install gir1.2-budgie\nsudo apt -f install\nsudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade\nsudo apt install --reinstall ubuntu-budgie-desktop budgie-desktop-environment\nsudo apt purge gir1.2-budgie-desktop\n```\n\nWe recommend removing the following applications to reduce your startup memory usage:\n\n```\nsudo apt purge gnome-contacts gnome-documents gnome-photos tracker\n```\n\nThe first time you run budgie-welcome, Tilix Quake mode (press F12) will be automatically enabled.\n\nPlease refer to the community wiki for more help:\n\n[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Upgrades](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Upgrades)\n\nAlso, Ask Ubuntu has an excellent guide to help you upgrade:\n\n[http://askubuntu.com/questions/110477/how-do-i-upgrade-to-a-newer-version-of-ubuntu](http://askubuntu.com/questions/110477/how-do-i-upgrade-to-a-newer-version-of-ubuntu)\n\n### Known issues\n\n- If you find that after the upgrade clicking the menu button crashes the panel, then CTRL+ALT+T to open a terminal then run:nohup budgie-panel --reset --replace &\n\n### How to upgrade from 16.04 to 17.10\n\nThere is not a direct 16.04 to 17.10 upgrade route. You are recommended to to-do a fresh install - obviously remembering to backup any important documents etc. first.\n\n# Download\n\nTo download the ISO, head on over to:\n\n[https://ubuntubudgie.org/downloads](https://ubuntubudgie.org/downloads)","src/content/blog/2017/09/17-10-release-notes.md",[1051],"images/ubuntu-budgie-17.10-final-small.jpg","d94d02cec499ae82",{"html":1054,"metadata":1055},"\u003Cp>\u003Cimg __ASTRO_IMAGE_=\"{&#x22;src&#x22;:&#x22;images/ubuntu-budgie-17.10-final-small.jpg&#x22;,&#x22;alt&#x22;:&#x22;Ubuntu Budgie 17.10&#x22;,&#x22;index&#x22;:0}\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"version\">Version\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Ubuntu Budgie v17.10 (artful) Release: Oct 19th, 2017\u003C/p>\n\u003Chr>\n\u003Ch1 id=\"new-features-and-enhancements\">New features and enhancements\u003C/h1>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>Files (Nautilus) 3.26 with Folder-Color to change color and add emblems to folders\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Files now come with Various Document Templates available to use\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Settings (gnome-control-center) has had a stylish makeover\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>GNOME-based apps are now available at the latest upstream version 3.26 (if released)\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Budgie-welcome now has proper header bars so can move the window!\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Budgie-welcome now translated now displays in multiple languages thanks to our fantastic \u003Ca href=\"https://www.transifex.com/ubuntu-budgie/budgie-welcome\">transifex\u003C/a>  translation team.

I have worked with upstream to resolve freezing issues when the applet is active. This patch has been submitted to Ubuntu Mate (who sponsor this package) and accepted for 17.10. I have backported this for 17.04 users as well.\n\nThis is now in budgie-welcome as well so that this applet - with all the other applets for Budgie Desktop is easily installable.\n\nIt was reported that a few budgie-remix users did not instantly see new installed packages appearing in the menu. I have backported a zesty patch for xenial users. This will be now resolved.\n\nDebian started its migration from GTK+3.22 to GTK+3.24. Unfortunately, not all went as planned and Debian Buster was left with a real mix and match. This broke budgie desktop and users were unable to login. Within a day I managed to push a bug-fix patch and ran around one weekend finding a sponsor to-do an emergency fix.\n\n# New Development\n\nI have packaged a promising new applet from an indie developer - budgie-weather-applet. It looks and works very nicely. Still early days. The requisite changes are now in budgie-welcome. Unfortunately, the applet does not compile under 16.04. So here is an opportunity - if you want to get it working, give us a shout and I'll try to give you a helping hand.\n\n\"Where Ubuntu Budgie leads... Ubuntu says ...'that is a good idea'!\"\n\nMy Rhythmbox make-over plugin called 'alternative-toolbar' which budgie-remix and Ubuntu Budgie have used in all their versions has now been pulled into Ubuntu itself. I've taken to fix up some usability issues (podcasts/radio stations) as well and this is now in 17.10.\n\nAfter struggling for more than a year I finally solved why my budgie version of indicator-sysmonitor was crashing. A one line code change! Anyway - enjoy, another applet now available in budgie-welcome.\n\nSpeaking of new development. New team member Jacob has been exploring new optional applets for you to investigate and add to your budgie desktop if you think they are useful.\n\n![Hotcorners](images/hotcorners.jpg)\n\n(hotcorner support)\n\n![Workspace overview](images/workspace-overview.jpg)\n\n(an alternative workspace overview/switcher)\n\n![Wallpaperworkspace](images/wallpaperworkspace.png)\n\n(different wallpaper per workspace)\n\n![Workspace switcher](images/workspace-switcher.jpg)\n\n(on demand workspace switcher)\n\nJust a few pictures - more about these later when we have created a simple installer and dusted off a few usability issues.\n\n... and new today - secret squirrel stuff - shush!\n\nWindow previews ...\n\n![Window%20preview](images/window20preview.jpg)\n\n(very early code - lets see if we can crack the intracasies around all of these)\n\n# Random Stuff\n\nOur website ubuntubudgie.org was up for renewal in September.\n\nThanks to your donations, we have renewed the domain for a further 3 years.

What this means is that new features are discouraged, and developers instead are encouraged to concentrate on bug-fixing.\n\n1. The ISO installer was missing budgie wallpaper. I fixed that... and at the same time, the installer dialog became Arc themed. Simply Gorgeous\n2. At beta 1 I had put in a workaround to enable budgie-welcome to work without crashing due to a new WebKit library. Shortly after, upstream had advised what the real fix should be and the fix was applied as required. The budgie-welcome package now operates much more smoothly. The new WebKit library is also due to be backported to 17.04 to fix additional security issues. Extra time was spent backporting the Artful fixes to the Zesty version of budgie-welcome to ensure it does not crash.\n3. More fixes were added to our desktop settings package budgie-desktop-environment. Tilix no longer throws the irritating VTE error if launched quickly after login. Also, I managed to squeeze in a Dark theming for Tilix (looks much better now!) and when highlighting terminal text, the text is now automatically copied to the clipboard.\n4. Our translators for budgie-welcome have been very busy. So these updated translations have been pulled in and updated in the repositories. Budgie-welcome is now truly multilingual!\n\n![Drawing](images/Selection_033.jpg)\n\n1. Caught a very irritating issue with Slick Greeter for those that use multiple desktop environments - slick greeter insisted in showing every desktop environment with a budgie logo. I pushed a pull-request to Linux Mint to get this fixed.\n2. In budgie-desktop 10.4 the budgie-desktop-settings application and the Plank application were not playing ball - there was a \"budgie panel\" icon that could not be removed from Plank. A simple fix was pushed to the upstream budgie-desktop project, and then uploaded to Ubuntu. This will also be backported to 17.04 and 16.04 in due course.\n3. gthumb was displaying a rather irritating menu addition to the headerbar breaking the look and feel to the app. Luckily the great gthumb devs upstream had fixed this, so I backported this fix for all Ubuntu users.\n4. Finally I have managed to track down why some app indicators were displaying huge icons. Bad bad apps - so we have basically ignored the sizing they wanted and sized it per the appindicator specification.\n\n# New Development\n\nIn the past weeks, Jacob has been working hard on a collection of Budgie-extras; a new set of handy applets to add to the default desktop. A sneak preview of two of the most recent developments includes the upcoming Window Previews:\n\n![Wpreviews](images/wpreviews.png)\n\nand a small, extremely easy and simple note applet; Quick Note:\n\n![Quicknote](images/quicknote.png)\n\nOther applets that were mentioned before, the Hot Corners, the Window Mover (move windows quickly among workspaces), the Workspace Overview (menu) and the Wallpaper Switcher are nearly finished.\n\nTo be continued!\n\n# Communications Infrastructure\n\nWhile we are busy with the upcoming 17.10 release, we have a few background things brewing that Dustin is working on. One of these such things has been how we would like to interact with the community in our real-time chat, as well as our internal communications.\n\nToday, the Ubuntu Budgie project leverages the Gitter platform for both internal and community communications. While the platform as a whole is quite decent, one reoccurring issue our team members are having is related to notifications. Gitter (with good intentions) intercepts all mobile notifications when you have a desktop client running. While this at its heart is appealing on some level, if you are in the scenario where you have multiple computers (any of which could have the Gitter client running) - at times this can be bad.\n\nWe are a distributed team (as nearly all OSS projects are), working from multiple time zones. Communication can happen at all hours of the day. Compound that with community members potentially needing assistance - missing notifications at times can be undesired. So with that transpiring, we are evaluating moving to a new platform. While we do not have many requirements, every bullet point is important to us.\n\n### Requirements\n\n- Must have a reliable method for our community members to join without issue.\n- Would prefer a web client to be available for the community members to keep the barrier to entry low.\n- Must support integrations - specifically GitHub, and Trello. But would like extensibility for future projects we are working on (bots, etc.).\n- Mobile and Desktop applications\n- Excellent notification system!!!!\n\n### Considerations\n\nIn no particular order, we have been looking at:\n\n- Discord\n- Slack\n- Mattermost\n- Hipchat\n- Riot\n- Rocketchat\n- Telegram\n- IRC\n\nSince Gitter is OSS, one may ask why we don't submit a PR, etc. The reason is due to other initiatives, having a smaller team and time constraints. We are trying to stay focused on the project at hand (Ubuntu Budgie).\n\n### Feedback\n\nWhat would you as the community like to see? Do you feel like we have overlooked any potential solutions? While we cannot please everyone, we are curious to see what your feedback would reflect.\n\n* * *\n\nDavid (project lead)","src/content/blog/2017/10/developer-diary-september.md",[1171,1172,1173,1174],"images/beta2.jpg","images/Selection_033.jpg","images/wpreviews.png","images/quicknote.png","cb6dcff835eb9515",{"html":1177,"metadata":1178},"\u003Ch1 id=\"our-fabulous-community\">Our fabulous community\u003C/h1>\n\u003Cp>Thank-you to everyone who has donated this month.

One of these such things has been how we would like to interact with the community in our real-time chat, as well as our internal communications.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Today, the Ubuntu Budgie project leverages the Gitter platform for both internal and community communications. While the platform as a whole is quite decent, one reoccurring issue our team members are having is related to notifications. Gitter (with good intentions) intercepts all mobile notifications when you have a desktop client running. While this at its heart is appealing on some level, if you are in the scenario where you have multiple computers (any of which could have the Gitter client running) - at times this can be bad.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>We are a distributed team (as nearly all OSS projects are), working from multiple time zones. Communication can happen at all hours of the day. Compound that with community members potentially needing assistance - missing notifications at times can be undesired. So with that transpiring, we are evaluating moving to a new platform.

Simply set a different layout with the application's window in front, and the layout is remembered for that specific application.\n\n**CountDown**\n\n![Countdown](images/countdown.png)\n\nCountDown is a desktop timer, with a number of options to be notified when the countdown is finished. Optionally, the applet can temporarily overrule suspend, to prevent the computer from stop counting.\n\n**Update of HotCorners**\n\nHotcorners saw its first major changes last week. A dropdown list with predefined, often used options was added to the menu, for convenient usage. Clicking the checkbox will now clear the entry to be able to set customized commands.\n\n![Menu](images/menu.png)\n\n**Coming soon: ClockWorks**\n\nNearly finished, available soon, is the ClockWorks Applet, a world clock applet. User can add, remove or rename clocks instantly.\n\n![ClockWorks](images/ClockWorks.png)","src/content/blog/2017/12/developer-diary-november.md",[1271,1272,1273,1274],"images/keyboardautoswitch.png","images/countdown.png","images/menu.png","images/ClockWorks.png","667bb871d9c30916",{"html":1277,"metadata":1278},"\u003Ch1 id=\"showcase\">Showcase\u003C/h1>\n\u003Ch1 id=\"development\">Development\u003C/h1>\n\u003Cp>A new release of the applet budgie-brightness-control was made available by its developer.

One of the reasons for moving to Discourse is making content more accessible and easier to find. Case and point, if you have a problem you would usually ask the question in our chatroom and wait for someone from our team or community to answer.\n\nHowever, due to the nature of the instant messaging platform, the answer is lost, and any new user-facing the same problem needs to ask the question again. With Discourse any question is easily searchable due to its static nature. It will help us to foster the community even further making it even more significant, especially with the upcoming release that will attract a lot of new users.\n\nYou can use your social accounts for easier registration or go for the proper old manual account registration. Among new feature is also the feature to receive a digest of essential threads to your email as well the notification when you get a response to your thread or post.\n\nWe will monitor the Gitter chat room for next three months and redirect new users to discourse. There will be a message explaining the transition when you join Gitter channel for any new or existing user in the meantime so that we can be sure everyone can move to Discourse. The intent, however, is that if we cannot answer the question immediately - we suggest moving the item into the forum directly.\n\nOverall this move will allow us to have a better communication hub similarly to AskUbuntu or UbuntuForums which will make it easier to answer any questions related to Ubuntu Budgie, gather further feedback and make it an enjoyable experience for everyone.\n\nOur discourse forum is not a replacement for AskUbuntu and UbuntuForums - these are naturally the critical support platforms for all things Ubuntu. Discourse is an added extra with a focus on all things Ubuntu Budgie (and not general Ubuntu issues).\n\nFor more information feel free to ask us in the comments to this post or via Gitter.\n\nYou can visit the forum at the following URL [https://discourse.ubuntubudgie.org](https://discourse.ubuntubudgie.org/)\n\n> One small (well not really small) note - Our beta 1 ISO is about to become available, and we could **REALLY** use your help in testing things out.

We have met several goals this year and including our stretch goal:\n\n- LTS Fiscal Goal - ensure that the costs to support a three-year LTS were in place.\n- Contribute on behalf of the Ubuntu Budgie community - a financial contribution for 2017 was donated to the Solus community since Solus provides much of the development behind the Budgie Desktop.\n- Stretch Goal - ensure we have reserves to meet five years of costs (2018 - 2022).\n\n**Operating Costs**\n\n- Infrastructure costs relating to the website, test build servers, domain registrations\n- Reserves are in place as a contingency to account for unexpected expenses.\n\n**Donations**\n\n_Patreon_\n\nFor 2017-2018 we did have a sizable number of **Patreon** donors - but due to **Patreon** changing their financial model in Dec 2017 we, unfortunately, lost many donors. **Patreon** has since rescinded this change, and our previous donors may want to reconsider becoming a **Patreon** since this gives Ubuntu Budgie a regular income.\n\n_PayPal_\n\nWe have had many individuals who donate via **Paypal**, and we thank you all!\n\n**Sponsorship**\n\n_Digital Ocean_\n\nWe have had a significant vote of confidence by **DigitalOcean** paying for all of our 2017 hosting and infrastructure fees and have committed to continuing this through to 2018-2019 fiscal year as well. [https://www.digitalocean.com](https://www.digitalocean.com/)\n\n_Discourse_\n\nAs some of you may know, we recently moved our community over to a discourse forum which was generously provided through sponsorship as well. [https://www.discourse.org/](https://www.discourse.org/)\n\n_Status.io_\n\nWhile this is yet to be implemented on our part, Status.io has provided a sponsorship that will help us keep our community up to date with system interruptions in our infrastructure. [https://status.io](https://status.io/)\n\n**Partnerships**\n\nBriefly, we had begun to offer Ubuntu Budgie preinstalled on systems from Nimbusoft. Unfortunately, due to the founder deciding to move in an alternative strategic direction, that association had to end. We do thank Chris Harvey (owner of Nimbusoft) for the very sizeable donation he has given to Ubuntu Budgie. [https://nimbusoft.com](https://nimbusoft.com/)\n\n**Future Goals**\n\nWe have set our sights this year to meet two very sizable cost goals; looking to fund equipment with HiDPI capability and with multiple HiDPI monitors. We recognise that more and more of our community use multi monitors and increasingly with HiDPI type resolutions. Unfortunately, we do not have such equipment to provide both development and support activities.\n\n**Contributions**\n\n- This year our community has contributed £2460.\n- We have a nominal £953.86 in the bank, with set-aside costs for 2018 to 2022 + reserves.\n\nOur confidence level for our financial viability is as close to 100% as you can get.\n\nAs a comparison for 2016-2017, our community contributed £248.90 with no set-aside costs and no reserves\n\n* * *\n\nWith your help, we look forward to making more donations to developers and organisations who have helped Ubuntu Budgie.\n\n* * *\n\n**The Team**\n\nAll Ubuntu Budgie team members including myself are volunteers. At this point we the team do not benefit financially in anyway from your generosity. If we had one or more full-time developers, then the speed of development and improvement would be exponentially higher. For this to become fiscally possible, the project would need to grow to approx 20x the current contribution rate to achieve that.\n\n**Canonical Support**\n\nAlthough we are now an official flavour of the Ubuntu Family, we do not receive any financial help from Canonical. Canonical supports Ubuntu Budgie through their launchpad build systems and ISO distribution costs.\n\n* * *\n\n**Thank You**\n\nAll donors are displayed on our website unless you specifically request not to be presented.\n\n**Donations**\n\nIf you would like to [support Ubuntu Budgie](https://ubuntubudgie.org/admin/blog/post/@page/5) , please feel free to donate to the project through either **Paypal** or **Patreon**.\n\nThank you to all who have chosen to join our community.\n\nDavid (project lead)","src/content/blog/2018/04/ubuntu-budgie-annual-financial-statement-2017-2018.md","cdec248b63ab46e9",{"html":1430,"metadata":1431},"\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Summary\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>As part of our commitment to be transparent with the community, the team is pleased to present a short statement of our financial position covering 2017 to 2018.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>History\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>Budgie Remix had launched in April 2016\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>In Nov 2016 Ubuntu Budgie was granted the status as an official community flavour with Ubuntu/Canonical.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>17.04 was our first release “official” release as a flavour.\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ul>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Goals\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>As we close off our fiscal year for 2018 (Apr 2017 - Mar 31, 2018), the financial position of the project is very healthy.

This Desktop based weather applet is installed by default and can be added to your panel.\n    \n    ![Weathershow applet](images/weathershow-applet.jpg)\n    \n- Kangaroo - Quick and easy browsing, across (possibly) many folder layers, without having to-do a single mouse click.\n\n![Kangaroo applet](images/kangaroo-applet.jpg)\n\n- App launcher - Display your favorite applications in a menu and on the panel.\n    \n    ![Applauncher applet](images/applauncher-applet.jpg)\n    \n- Trash applet (vala based) - Show, hide and restore trash items.\n    \n    ![Trash applet](images/trash-applet.jpg)\n    \n- Recently Used (vala based) - Show recently used items in a menu.\n    \n    ![Recentlyused applet](images/recentlyused-applet.jpg)\n    \n\nA couple of existing applets have been rewritten from Python based to Vala based. This has been done to greatly enhance the speed of the applets and make them memory efficient; in addition they have picked up a few enhancements so browse around in the applet setting to discover whats new\n\n- Quick Notes\n- Hot Corners\n\nWe are also pleased to show-case many more indie developer applets - to just pick a few:\n\n- Advanced Brightness Controller - Control the backlight via your graphics driver controller or GNOME's brightness controller.\n    \n    ![Advanced brightness applet](images/advanced-brightness-applet.jpg)\n    \n- Browser Profile Launcher - Launch and create multiple Chromium/Chrome profiles.\n\n![Browser profile launcher applet](images/browser-profile-launcher-applet.jpg)\n\n**In total Ubuntu Budgie users have direct install access to twenty-seven applets through budgie-welcome**\n\nIf you want to showcase your applet in UB contact us and let us know about your project.\n\n# Budgie Desktop\n\nWhilst v10.5 was not made official by the time of Cosmic Feature freeze, we have grabbed as much as we can to showcase the good work that has been made by Solus and the wider budgie development community.\n\nWe are particularly proud of Canonical's Iain Lane (Laney) who provided a massive mutter compatible patch. Without it we would not have been able to bring you 18.10. Cheers Iain :)\n\nFrom myself I have built upon Iain's good work to resolve as many GTK+3.24 and Mutter 3.30 introduced issues as we have been able to.\n\nFrom upstream's [blog](https://getsol.us/2018/08/10/summertime-solus/) , in no particular order look out for the following:\n\n- Raven Sound Output widget enables you to do global as well as per-app volume control and output device changing\n- Raven Sound Input widget enables you to do microphone control and input device changing.\n- Ability to mute / unmute applications and an option to allow raising volume above 100%\n- New Raven section in Budgie Desktop Settings. Under this new section, you’re able to show and hide individual widgets as well as enable the ability to raise your volume above 100% in Raven.\n- Ability to enable window focus change to being on mouse enter / leave via the “Windows” section of Budgie Desktop Settings, as opposed to click-to-focus.\n- The “Fonts” section of Budgie Desktop Settings introduces a new Text Scaling option\n- Ability to dismiss individual notifications\n- Notification grouping on an application basis\n- Large Notifications are now truncated to prevent huge notification windows being displayed\n- Caffeine powered - new applet that prevents screen dimming and lock screen triggering. This is now the default on the panel\n- You can now middle click on the Bluetooth applet to toggle Bluetooth airplane mode.\n- You can now middle click on the Sound applet to mute and unmute global audio.\n- We now hide the add workspace button in the Workspace Applet during initialization.\n- Icon Task List Grouping - displayed icons can optionally group the windows of the same application\n\n# Key features available to UB from Ubuntu\n\n- GNOME 3.30 applications\n- Linux Kernel 4.18\n- A shed-load of fixes throughout the Ubuntu stack - congrats on all Canonical, Ubuntu devs, Debian devs and literally all devs in the free software community for all of their hard-work which everyone should be very happy about :)\n\n# UB Maintained packages\n\nApart from the above (!) UB maintains a number of Debian packages. New versions available in 18.10 include:\n\n- rhythmbox-plugin-alternative-toolbar\n- faba-icon-theme\n- slick-greeter\n- GTK+3.24 fixed version of budgie-haste-applet\n- GTK+3.24 fixed version of budgie-screenshot-applet\n- Arc-Theme\n\n# Other distros\n\nWe are particularly pleased to see our Budgie Applets now available to the wider Linux community. If you are on Arch Linux / Manjaro, look out for \"budge-extras\" in your official Arch community repository. Debian Buster is now sync'd with Ubuntu and will now continue to receive the latest developments from the UB team.\n\n# Issues Resolved:\n\n- ShowTime crashes & HiDPI positioning\n- Hotcorners activation issues when using HiDPI displays\n- Various display issues for Window Previews\n\n# Known Issues:\n\n- If you find that after the upgrade clicking the menu button crashes the panel, then CTRL+ALT+T to open a terminal then run:\n\n```\nnohup budgie-panel --reset --replace &\n```\n\n- Window artefacts displayed when using the budgie menu, notifications and alt+tab. For the interim please disable window animations from budgie-settings. We'll continue to investigate.\n- Workspace switching - switching animation is now up/down instead of the usual left/right.\n- Super +D Showdesktop does not work\n- Showtime settings color button is always white\n- Dropby popover does not popup when a USB device is inserted\n- Some apps do not respect left/right decoration placement\n\n# Upgrading\n\n## How to upgrade from 18.04 to 18.10\n\n**IMPORTANT:** remember to double-check you have the following vital package before you upgrade:\n\n```\nsudo apt install ubuntu-budgie-desktop\n```\n\nAfter the release of 18.10, you will be offered to upgrade when you run Software & Updates - BUT IMPORTANTLY - you need to first switch to being offered updates \"For Any Version\" in the Update tab of Update Manager - Settings.\n\nAlternatively, from a command line run:\n\n```\nupdate-manager\n```\n\n**IMPORTANT** We do not recommend running `do-release-upgrade` from a Tilix terminal since this will hang during the upgrade. If you want to use `do-release-upgrade` switch to a TTY and login before running the command.\n\nSome of the packages that were installed as part of the Ubuntu Budgie backports PPA (ppa:ubuntubudgie/backports) will be uninstalled as part of the upgrade. Use budgie-welcome to reinstall anything that is removed.\n\nWe also recommend you reset the panel to benefit from the revised Pocillo theme and applets:\n\n```\nnohup budgie-panel --reset --replace &\n```\n\n* * *\n\nPlease refer to the community wiki for more help:\n\n[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Upgrades](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Upgrades)\n\nAlso, Ask Ubuntu has an excellent guide to help you upgrade:\n\n[http://askubuntu.com/questions/110477/how-do-i-upgrade-to-a-newer-version-of-ubuntu](http://askubuntu.com/questions/110477/how-do-i-upgrade-to-a-newer-version-of-ubuntu)\n\n# Download\n\nTo download the ISO, head on over to:\n\n[https://ubuntubudgie.org/downloads](https://ubuntubudgie.org/downloads)\n\n# Getting support\n\nThanks to the generosity of discourse.org, our support site is the key site for all things Ubuntu Budgie.\n\nOne to book-mark [https://discourse.ubuntubudgie.org](https://discourse.ubuntubudgie.org/)\n\nMore information can be found [here](https://ubuntubudgie.org/admin/blog/post/@blog/id?id=39) .\n\n![Discourse](images/discourse.png)","src/content/blog/2018/09/18-10-release-notes.md",[1629,1630,1631,1632,1633,1634,1635,1326],"images/weathershow-applet.jpg","images/kangaroo-applet.jpg","images/applauncher-applet.jpg","images/trash-applet.jpg","images/recentlyused-applet.jpg","images/advanced-brightness-applet.jpg","images/browser-profile-launcher-applet.jpg","320c52797e7294ef",{"html":1638,"metadata":1639},"\u003Cp>Version\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Ubuntu Budgie v18.10 (Cosmic Cuttlefish)\u003C/strong> \u003Cstrong>Release:\u003C/strong> Oct 18th, 2018\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Ubuntu Budgie 18.10 will be supported for 9 months until July 2019.

There were a lot of issues, but for those with mobile phones/table one of the most noticeable was the website scrolling horizontally when viewed on smaller resolution, not fitting the view resolution of device. Using flex property in CSS we were able to have it fixed to some point, but it wasn't really elegant solution and there were other visual problems as well.\n\nOne of the main reason for the switch was the software itself and the associated libraries and software not being updated by developers for quite sometime. Back in the day, around 2016, PageKit was one of the lightest CMS - Content Management Systems, being able to use SQLlite database and still offer the performance on par with MySQL database. Also it was quite modular, which allowed you to build any website that you wanted with coding skills but was also simple to use for the newcomers without any skills.\n\nHowever, at some point, the updates to the core libraries like Vue.JS and, the UIKit the CSS framework simply stopped. The development was going slowly and some of the updates were released to patch security issue. With each update however, the system was more vulnerable, since the old version of the Vue.js and other scripts were simply making the whole thing hard to maintain. Back then we were one of the biggest websites using PageKit which also added to its promotion. When we saw that there won't be any progress, we decided to make the switch to WordPress.\n\nWhile our decision was hard one, in the end, it was right decision.\n\nWordPress allowed us to reconstruct website from the bottom while still preserving the old look and improving it on the go. In a sense you could say that the website has been reforged. :)\n\nPreviously, and this was requested multiple times, there was no easy way to add translations to different languages beside English to the website. The translation system was unreliable and not ready for multilanguage website.\n\nThe Google Translator was so-so at best and at most annoying for most users so decided to remove it and not have any translation than a broken one.\n\nWhile developing new website, we tested out various solutions and confirmed that the translation of the new website would be a lot easier than with PageKit.\n\nWe decided that once the development phase was done, website structure finalized and new website published to the community that it would be perfect time to work on translation of website to various languages. Please follow our social networks, Twitter, Facebook, our Discourse forum, to be notified on how you can help with the translation. We are going to have roll out 2 additional languages first and then after some time add more and more.\n\nOne of the new things that you can use while on our website is the instant search Powered by Algolia which retrieves the results as you type. The new website offers both the pleasant mobile and desktop experience without sacrificing anything.\n\nSome of the optimization is done on the script and theme level while the other optimization is done server side which allows us to make the website load quite faster when compared to old website.\n\nWe also gained new Patreon Platinum Sponsor - UpCloud which offers cloud hosting for developers and allows developers to deploy their applications and services to their cloud infrastructure.  I would like to use this opportunity to once again thank the guys at UpCloud for helping us finance buying hardware used for development of the Ubuntu Budgie and its applets.\n\n[![](images/upcloud_logo_horizontal-300x62.png)](https://upcloud.com/signup/?promo=budgie)\n\nBe sure to follow our blog and social channels, as well our Discourse forum for future updates in regards to website and Ubuntu Budgie itself!","src/content/blog/2020/01/welcome-to-new-ubuntu-budgie-website.md",[1698],"images/upcloud_logo_horizontal-300x62.png","f1f39297cf2a07f4",{"html":1701,"metadata":1702},"\u003Cp>Hi everyone,\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>We hope you are having great time.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>We would like to share with you our development journal with special focus on Ubuntu Budgie’s new website.\u003C/p>\n\u003C!--more-->\n\u003Cp>Few months ago we’ve decided to switch from our old website to the current website.

In a sense you could say that the website has been reforged. :)\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Previously, and this was requested multiple times, there was no easy way to add translations to different languages beside English to the website. The translation system was unreliable and not ready for multilanguage website.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The Google Translator was so-so at best and at most annoying for most users so decided to remove it and not have any translation than a broken one.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>While developing new website, we tested out various solutions and confirmed that the translation of the new website would be a lot easier than with PageKit.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>We decided that once the development phase was done, website structure finalized and new website published to the community that it would be perfect time to work on translation of website to various languages. Please follow our social networks, Twitter, Facebook, our Discourse forum, to be notified on how you can help with the translation. We are going to have roll out 2 additional languages first and then after some time add more and more.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>One of the new things that you can use while on our website is the instant search Powered by Algolia which retrieves the results as you type. The new website offers both the pleasant mobile and desktop experience without sacrificing anything.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Some of the optimization is done on the script and theme level while the other optimization is done server side which allows us to make the website load quite faster when compared to old website.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>We also gained new Patreon Platinum Sponsor - UpCloud which offers cloud hosting for developers and allows developers to deploy their applications and services to their cloud infrastructure.  I would like to use this opportunity to once again thank the guys at UpCloud for helping us finance buying hardware used for development of the Ubuntu Budgie and its applets.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"https://upcloud.com/signup/?promo=budgie\">\u003Cimg __ASTRO_IMAGE_=\"{&#x22;src&#x22;:&#x22;images/upcloud_logo_horizontal-300x62.png&#x22;,&#x22;alt&#x22;:&#x22;&#x22;,&#x22;index&#x22;:0}\">\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Be sure to follow our blog and social channels, as well our Discourse forum for future updates in regards to website and Ubuntu Budgie itself!\u003C/p>",{"headings":1703,"localImagePaths":1704,"remoteImagePaths":1705,"frontmatter":1706,"imagePaths":1708},[],[1698],[],{"title":1691,"description":1693,"pubDate":1707,"category":133,"author":27,"image":1694},["Date","2020-01-14T00:00:00.000Z"],[1698],"2020/01/welcome-to-new-ubuntu-budgie-website.md","2020/02/congratulation-to-winners-of-20-04-wallpaper-competition",{"id":1710,"data":1712,"body":1716,"filePath":1717,"assetImports":1718,"digest":1730,"rendered":1731,"legacyId":1740},{"title":1713,"pubDate":1714,"author":11,"description":1715,"draft":102},"Congratulations to the winners of the 20.04 Ubuntu Budgie wallpaper competition",["Date","2020-02-11T00:00:00.000Z"],"Wallpaper Competition for 20.04 completed","We would like to thank all of our users that have participated in our Wallpaper Competition to select the desktop artwork for the upcoming Ubuntu Focal 20.04 LTS release of Ubuntu Budgie.

Stylish menu applet as the default\n2. budgie based network manager applet as the default\n3. Window Shuffler - animations, faster, keyboard friendly tiling CTRL+ALT+keypad numbers; The currently focussed window can be now tiled to each corner, side to side or maximized/unmaximized all from the keyboard.

This takes the 19.10/19.04 and 18.10 release notes and highlights the key parts that 18.04 upgraders need to be aware of.\n\nIf you are upgrading from 19.10 we have a [release note](https://ubuntubudgie.org/2020/04/02/ubuntu-budgie-20-04lts-release-notes/ \"release note\") more applicable to you!\n\nIn these release notes the areas covered are:\n\n- New features and enhancements\n- Issues Resolved\n- Upgrading from 18.04 Ubuntu Budgie\n- Known Issues when upgrading\n- Where to download Ubuntu Budgie\n\n\\[caption id=\"attachment\\_1756\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"744\"\\]![Ub Desktop 2004](images/ub_desktop_2004-744x393.jpg) UB Desktop 20.04\\[/caption\\]\n\n# NEW FEATURES AND ENHANCEMENTS\n\n## 20.04 STUFF TO LOOK OUT FOR\n\n- Stylish menu applet as the default\n- budgie based network manager applet as the default\n- Window Shuffler - animations, faster, keyboard friendly tiling CTRL+ALT+keypad numbers; The currently focussed window can be now tiled to each corner, side to side or maximized/unmaximized all from the keyboard. Give it a try (enable via Menu - Shuffler control).\n- Desktop Layouts - choose your default desktop layout with one click\n- 4K resolution friendly budgie desktop and budgie applet support\n- GNOME Firmware and Drawing are new default applications\n- Ubuntu Budgie Team Wallpapers for 20.04 - there was a community contest to choose its favourite wallpapers - and the community certainly contributed [amazing desktop images](https://ubuntubudgie.org/2020/02/11/congratulation-to-winners-of-20-04-wallpaper-competition/ \"amazing\"). I hope you like them. We will next run a community contest for the 22.04 LTS\n- All our backport packages have now been rebuilt for 20.04 - look out for nemo-share and nemo-dropbox and also skippy-xd is available through backports.\n- Firefox is the default browser.\n- Catfish file and text search is now a default install\n- The community has requested Files (Nautilus) to be switched to Files (Nemo) - so welcome back split screen and other goodies. Tip - press Alt or right-click the toolbar to show the Menu for preferences etc.\n- budgie-nemo integration - right click options for changing the background, launch budgie-desktop-settings and catfish file & text search. Nemo folder-color is unfortunately not available in the repositories, so it has been dropped.\n- QogirBudgie from the fiendishly clever themer vinceliuice - so three of the best themes are now default in budgie-desktop-settings (Arc, Pocillo and QogirBudgie)\n- As the community has requested, Plank dock has now been switched to the bottom of the screen, is transparent and has the bounce animations by default\n\n## BUDGIE DESKTOP:\n\nUbuntu Budgie 20.04 LTS ships with budgie-desktop v10.5.1. This is a massive upgrade for 18.04 users and the updates are too extensive to list. So here are the areas you should go/look and discover!\n\n- Raven - Sound controls\n- New Raven section in Budgie Desktop Settings.\n- Ability to enable window focus change to being on mouse enter / leave via the “Windows” section of Budgie Desktop Settings, as opposed to click-to-focus.\n- The “Fonts” section of Budgie Desktop Settings introduces hint, Text Scaling and anti-aliasing options\n- Raven Notification grouping and the ability to turn off notifications. Look out for setting the Notification position as well.\n- You can now middle click on the Bluetooth applet to toggle Bluetooth airplane mode. You can now middle click on the Sound applet to mute and unmute global audio.\n- Icon Task List has received a lot of love; Grouping, launching instances via middle lick, favourites.\n- Under the Desktop section of Budgie Desktop Settings, you'll find a new option called “Number of virtual desktops”, where you can go from just having one workspace up to eight!\n\n### Ubuntu Budgie Experience\n\nThe following areas have been added or changed to enhance our budgie-desktop implementation:\n\n- System Tray applet now dropped as a default - it is buggy and the network manager applet is now/intended as a default\n- At the same time - added the ability to not run network-manager applet - this ensures the buggy system tray icon no longer appears\n- CTRL+ALT+left/right swaps workspaces without a workspace indicator in the middle of the screen. This has been done to speed up switching workspaces & most importantly removes the possibility of crashes due to conflicts with the workspace animations\n- Event alerts sounds are disabled by default now - if you want alert sounds choose the alert noise you want and sound level in Settings - Sound\n- HiDPI (4K) support for Budgie applets (both in built-in and third-party) and their popup functionality\n- Fix for keyboard shortcuts mysteriously going missing\n- Fix for multimonitors to stop windows overlapping the top-bar when maximised\n- Switch from qt5-style-plugins to qt5ct for QT app styling - apps such as vlc. You should see a QT5 Config app now in the menu to help you configure styling of QT apps. Also to note - some QT5 apps such as VLC also have styling options built in as well.\n- Moka based icons revised to capture GNOME 3.32/3.34 and 3.36 changes\n- Support large global menu in budgie-desktop panel\n- Better lock screen styling - buttons are now flat and match the lock screen dialog\n- Pixel Saver & Pocillo: Close button is now styled to match CSD windows\n- Stylish menu applet as the default\n- budgie based network manager applet as the default\n- Window Shuffler - animations, faster, keyboard friendly tiling CTRL+ALT+keypad numbers; The currently focussed window can be now tiled to each corner, side to side or maximized/unmaximized all from the keyboard. Give it a try (enable via Menu - Shuffler control).\n- 4K resolution friendly budgie desktop and budgie applet support\n- GNOME Firmware and Drawing are new default applications\n- All our backport packages have now been rebuilt for 20.04 - look out for nemo-share and nemo-dropbox and also skippy-xd is available through backports.\n- We have dropped TLP from the default install. The power savings in the latest kernels are significant for newer computers. TLP is still available to be installed if the kernel power savings do not impact you due to using an older CPU.\n- The caffeine appindicator has been dropped - this has been replaced with the native caffeine budgie-applet that comes with budgie-desktop v10.5\n- We've added a new game 2048 as part of the default install - a great way to while away a few hours\n- Catfish file and text search is now a default install\n- The community has requested Files (Nautilus) to be switched to Files (Nemo) - so welcome back split screen and other goodies. Tip - press Alt or right-click the toolbar to show the Menu for preferences etc.\n- budgie-nemo integration - right click options for changing the background, launch budgie-desktop-settings and catfish file & text search. Nemo folder-color is unfortunately not available in the repositories, so it has been dropped.\n- QogirBudgie from the fiendishly clever themer vinceliuice - so three of the best themes are now default in budgie-desktop-settings (Arc, Pocillo and QogirBudgie)\n- Advanced Network Configuration, LibreOffice Math, Software Sources and Additional Drivers are now available from the menu\n- As the community has requested, Plank dock has now been switched to the bottom of the screen, is transparent and has the bounce animations by default\n- UB logo is proudly displayed in the About screen and is the default menu icon\n- ability to increase the spacer applet sizing without impacting the overall size of the panel.\n- ability to launch applications from the menu requiring elevated privileges\n\nNote also GNOME Upstream have now removed the split of Application Menus from the Window menu. So for Budgie this means there is no separate “Application” icon in the decoration to show the appmenu. Appmenus are now combined in the Window menu.\n\n## Desktop Layouts\n\nFor 20.04 LTS we now support a one click method to set up your desktop with a look and feel that you are most comfortable with.\n\n\\[caption id=\"attachment\\_1632\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"744\"\\]![Layouts](images/layouts-744x410.jpg) Layouts\\[/caption\\]\n\nAccessed through the Menu - Themes & Layouts, the following layouts can be used:\n\n- Traditional Budgie\n- Classic Ubuntu Budgie\n- Ubuntu Budgie\n- Cupertino\n- The One\n- redmond\n\nChoosing a layout replaces your current setup with a predefined panel and applet layout. Combine that with the theme makeover option, you now have a extremely fast method to configure Ubuntu Budgie the way you want to.\n\n## BUDGIE APPLETS & BUDGIE MINI-APPS\n\n### WeatherShow\n\nWeather forecast every three hours and over five days. This Desktop based weather applet is installed by default and can be added to your panel.\n\n\\[caption id=\"attachment\\_1709\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"744\"\\]![Weathershow Applet](images/weathershow-applet-744x402.jpg) Weathershow Applet\\[/caption\\]\n\n### Budgie Applications Menu\n\nWe are pleased to ship by default our take on a simple but elegant menu for our desktop. Heavily based upon the good work of the ElementaryOS crew, this menu displays your installed applications via a Grid View as well as the traditional category view budgie users know and love.\n\n\\[caption id=\"attachment\\_1648\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"744\"\\]![Appscreen](images/appscreen-744x385.jpg) Appscreen\\[/caption\\]\n\nWe have enhanced the menu to optionally show the budgie powerstrip - so for those users who dont want to use the default power applet in the panel. The menu has many extra features - e.g. right click action options for those applications live steam that offer them.\n\n\\[caption id=\"attachment\\_1637\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"744\"\\]![Appmenu3](images/appmenu3-744x637.jpg) Appmenu3\\[/caption\\]\n\n… a couple of hidden extras - type 2+2 - its a built in calculator or type ubuntubudgie.org into the search.\n\nAgain optionally - if you install zeitgeist the menu will start to learn what you frequently search for - and the search results be more tailored to your frequent requests - i.e. find things first time.\n\n### Network Manager Applet\n\nBudgie Desktop has shipped with a legacy network manager icon in the panel. It has never integrated very well - and together with the buggy system tray weird icon effects were visible on logon.\n\n\\[caption id=\"attachment\\_1630\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"303\"\\]![Nm1](images/nm1.jpg) Nm1\\[/caption\\]\n\nEnter the native Network Manager budgie applet. This integrates fully with our budgie desktop. We have tidied up and built upon the good work of the Daniel Pinto (original creator) and the ElementaryOS team from which the budgie-applet was derived from.\n\n### Budgie Window Shuffler\n\nFocal's Window Shuffler is a completely rewritten and re- designed version of Budgie's tiling add-on. Apart from the drastically improved responsiveness, features now include:\n\n- Setting margins and padding of the window grid \\[caption id=\"attachment\\_1629\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"600\"\\]![Shuff1](images/shuff1.jpg) Shuff1\\[/caption\\]\n- Shortcuts for snapping windows to the nearest tile\n- Shortcuts for resizing windows in all directions\n- Scroll over the GUI grid to set its shade\n- Targeted position preview when using the GUI grid \\[caption id=\"attachment\\_1628\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"600\"\\]![Shuff2](images/shuff2.jpg) Shuff2\\[/caption\\]\n- Animated window movement when using shortcuts to move windows\n- Swapping windows in case a window is moved to an existing window's position\n- Shortcuts for Quarter / half tiling\n\nThe new Shuffler Control window \\[caption id=\"attachment\\_1627\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"744\"\\]![Shuff3](images/shuff3-744x660.jpg) Shuff3\\[/caption\\]\n\n### Wallstreet\n\nOne request that continually was made was to have the ability to rotate through a folder full of photos and display on your desktop. We know there are many heavy-weight tools out there - but what our community wanted is a simple - very lightweight solution built into the desktop.\n\n\\[caption id=\"attachment\\_1625\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"535\"\\]![Wallstreet](images/wallstreet.jpg) Wallstreet\\[/caption\\]\n\nEnter - WallStreet - a new lightweight wallpaper rotator every x minutes. Just enable it through the menu - wallstreet control\n\n### Visual-Space\n\nNew applet budgie-visualspace-applet - a stylish compact workspace switcher as a default on the panel.\n\n\\[caption id=\"attachment\\_1626\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"501\"\\]![Visualspace](images/visualspace.jpg) Visualspace\\[/caption\\]\n\nSo this desktop focused productivity tool is used if you have lots of windows spread over your desktop and/or between workspaces - you can quickly focus that window without having to alt-tab through everything.\n\n### Dropby\n\nDropby applet makes a reappearance as a default panel applet\n\n\\[caption id=\"attachment\\_1650\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"498\"\\]![Dropby](images/dropby-1.jpg) Dropby\\[/caption\\]\n\nWhen any USB device is connected then you have easy access to it - with the ability to copy its contents, open to see what is on it and to eject the device safely directly from a popup and panel applet.\n\n### Other notable applets and mini apps\n\n- Kangaroo - Quick and easy browsing, across (possibly) many folder layers, without having to-do a single mouse click.\n- App launcher - Display your favorite applications in a menu and on the panel.\n- Trash applet (vala based) - Show, hide and restore trash items.\n- Recently Used (vala based) - Show recently used items in a menu.\n- Quick Notes & Hot Corners: These existing applets have been rewritten from Python based to Vala based. This has been done to greatly enhance the speed of the applets and make them memory efficient; in addition they have picked up a few enhancements so browse around in the applet setting to discover whats new\n- New Pomodoro like applet Take-A-Break\n    - QUICKCHAR MINI APP - Quickly find and choose the equivalent locale character for an ascii character. Press Super+Alt+C to call the window. Type a character, and all its derivates will appear. Click one (or tab to the targeted character and press Return) and the character will be pasted into the document. Press again to toggle visibility, or Escape to hide\n    - FUZZYCLOCK APPLET - Shows the time in a Fuzzy Way. Supports 24-hour format Supports Dates Supports Horizontal Panels\n\n\\[caption id=\"attachment\\_1417\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"640\"\\]![Fuzzy](images/fuzzy.png) Fuzzy\\[/caption\\] This is a new applet contributed by community member Adam Dyess - Thanks Adam!\n\n- WORKSPACE STOPWATCH APPLET - Workspace Timer Applet is an applet to keep track of usage per workspace, e.g. to find out how much minutes/hours were actually spent on a job. Workspaces can be freely named, custom names and all data are rmembered, also after logout/restart, until the RESET button is pressed. The log file is updated on workspace switch/clicking the icon for popup or else every 30 seconds. Time during suspend is automatically retracted from a workspace time.\n    \n- BUDGIE-BRIGHTNESS-CONTROLLER APPLET - Brightness Controller is a Budgie Desktop applet allowing you to control the desktop/laptop brightness via your hardware brightness controller or via Xorg as a fallback.\n    \n\n\\[caption id=\"attachment\\_1419\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"200\"\\]![Brightnesscontroller](images/brightnesscontroller.jpg) Brightnesscontroller\\[/caption\\]\n\n- BUDGIE STATUS-NOTIFIER - display status notifications\n    \n- Showtime - Adds automatic multi-monitor support for Showtime\n    \n- Display Window Mover applet correctly on primary monitor when multiple monitors are available\n    \n- Rework Dropby to display in an independent window rather than a popup - this resolves panel freeze issues.\n    \n- Weathershow applet - Display temperature correctly on vertical panels\n    \n- Tweaked budgie-pixel-saver-applet to correctly handle displaying Titles/Titles & Buttons/Buttons\n    \n\nAll these productivity applets and mini-apps are now available from Budgie Welcome - select Menu - Budgie Applets\n\n### WINDOW PREVIEWS\n\nWindow previews (Alt Tab replacement) has been rewritten in vala - faster with per workspace/all workspaces and shift backwards controls. Additionally, Alt Above-Tab shows windows of the currently active application only.\n\n\\[caption id=\"attachment\\_1415\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"640\"\\]![Previews](images/previews.png) Previews\\[/caption\\]\n\nRemember, budgie-applets showcases many more indie developer applets\n\nIn total Ubuntu Budgie users have direct install access to 35 budgie applets and budgie mini-apps through budgie-welcome\n\nIf you want to showcase your applet in UB contact us and let us know about your project. Daily builds for budgie-extras is available - so to get the latest (warts and all) ppa:ubuntubudgie-dev/budgie-extras-daily\n\n## Budgie Welcome\n\n### Budgie Themes & Layouts\n\nWe have shipped for a few releases now the ability via one-click to completely update the look of your desktop - cursors, icons, themes etc. From 20.04, this makeover ability can now be individually applied i.e. just the theme, or icon etc. giving you an easy way to mix and match between different makeovers.\n\n\\[caption id=\"attachment\\_1631\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"744\"\\]![Makeover](images/makeover-744x407.jpg) Makeover\\[/caption\\]\n\nLatest version of vimix theme available through Menu - Budgie Themes & Layouts is shipped in 20.04 together with QogirBudgie (available by default on the installation)\n\n## Default Applications\n\n### Drawing\n\n\\[caption id=\"attachment\\_1635\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"683\"\\]![Drawing](images/drawing.jpg) Drawing\\[/caption\\]\n\nWe are pleased to ship by default the stylish new Drawing application. This application is a basic image editor, similar to Microsoft Paint, but aiming at the GNOME based desktops such as GNOME Shell and Budgie Desktop. PNG, JPEG and BMP format files are supported.\n\n### GNOME Firmware\n\nUbuntu Budgie now ships with GNOME Firmware - it is really a power user tool to resolve those specific vendor device issues that can be resolved by firmware. We don't expect you to generally use this to update stuff - only update if you are having issues that cannot be resolved by updating the linux kernel. Also to note - not all manufacturers release firmware that can be installed via linux - you may still have to resort to MS Windows based upgrades.\n\n### Celluloid\n\n\\[caption id=\"attachment\\_1636\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"744\"\\]![Celluloid](images/celluloid-744x482.jpg) Celluloid\\[/caption\\]\n\nCelluloid has now replaced gnome-mpv\n\n### Samba\n\nSamba has been removed as a default install\n\n### Android Phone integration\n\nUbuntu Budgie now provides seamless desktop-to/from-android phone transfer capabilities - we now ship with go-mtpfs by default. Simply plug-in your android phone and it will appear automatically in nemo allowing you to copy files/photos etc between your phone and the desktop.\n\n### ACCESSIBILITY\n\nWe have taken a closer look at making our distro more easy to use for those of us who need just a little extra help. This is where we need your help. What tricks & techniques are you aware of that helps improve the accessibility of the desktop?\n\nWe have incorporated a super useful screen magnifier - just enable via the Settings - Accessibility options\n\nBind both Super + Alt + = and Super + Alt + + as zoom-in keys\n\n![Magni](images/magni.png)\n\nAlso we have included the on-screen keyboard (onboard) ### NVIDIA\n\nOur distro now includes the NVIDIA proprietary driver sets on its ISO. This allows NVIDIA users to install & configure drivers out of the box without needing an internet connection. Just click the wifi installer option to install the correct NVIDIA driver for your computer - obviously assuming that your hardware needs it.\n\nLikewise, we have added support for Optimus graphics switching direct from the budgie panel. If you have Optimus graphics look for the intel/nvidia icon to switch between your intel & nvidia GPUs.\n\n\\[caption id=\"attachment\\_1413\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"640\"\\]![Nvidia Menu](images/nvidia_menu.png) Nvidia Menu\\[/caption\\]\n\n## KEY FEATURES AVAILABLE TO UB FROM UBUNTU\n\n- Linux kernel v5.4\n- GNOME 3.36 applications\n- Latest version of LibreOffice 6.4\n- Latest ZFS support with automatic APT rollback support\n- A shed-load of fixes throughout the Ubuntu stack - congrats on all Canonical, Ubuntu devs, Debian devs and all devs in the free software community for all of their hard-work which everyone should be pleased about ?\n- What does all that mean - most cutting edge yet stable software that brings great benefits for brand new hardware compatibility - including support for the very latest games.\n\n## UB MAINTAINED PACKAGES\n\nApart from the above (!) UB maintains many Debian packages. New versions available in 20.04 include:\n\n- Slick Greeter\n- Login Window Preferences\n- DesktopFolder\n\n## ISSUES RESOLVED:\n\n- GNOME Software Updates tab has been hidden - it doesn't really work and the recommended update process is via Menu - Software & Updates\n- Fixed budgie-desktop bug to allow custom layouts that include left & right panels.\n- Papercut - uninstalling default applets now no longer uninstalls the Ubuntu Budgie desktop environment.\n- Budgie Desktop now includes a patch developed by myself hopefully to reduce the number of crash reports you see on first logon.\n\n## KNOWN ISSUES:\n\n- When installed on default VirtualBox settings or QEMU, on first logon the session will crash when budgie-welcome is first open. The session also crashes when other applications such as Settings is open. [https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/xorg-server/+bug/1745345](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/xorg-server/+bug/1745345)\n- For virtualbox ensure the VMSVGA graphics driver is used in the virtual machine settings\n- For QEMU use the VMVGA graphics driver.\n- Alternatively for both uninstall the gstreamer1.0-vaapi package\n- If you find that after the upgrade clicking the menu button crashes the panel, then CTRL+ALT+T to open a terminal then run:\n- `nohup budgie-panel --reset --replace &`\n- Launching terminal based apps from the menu does not work. Workaround is to fool GLib to assume that a supported terminal (tilix isnt supported) is installed `sudo ln -s /usr/bin/tilix /usr/bin/nxterm`. [https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/budgie-desktop/+bug/1873428](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/budgie-desktop/+bug/1873428)\n- Please read the [Ubuntu Release](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/FocalFossa/ReleaseNotes \"Ubuntu\") notes which covers issues common to all Ubuntu Flavors.\n\n# UPGRADING\n\n## HOW TO UPGRADE FROM 18.10/19.04/19.10 TO 20.04\n\nIMPORTANT: remember to double-check you have the following vital package before you upgrade:\n\n```\nsudo apt install ubuntu-budgie-desktop\n```\n\nAfter the release of 20.04, you will be offered to upgrade when you run Software & Updates. Alternatively, from a command line run:\n\n```\nupdate-manager\n```\n\nIMPORTANT We do not recommend running `do-release-upgrade` from a Tilix terminal since this will hang during the upgrade. If you want to use do-release-upgrade switch to a TTY and login before running the command.\n\nSome of the packages that were installed as part of the Ubuntu Budgie backports PPA (ppa:ubuntubudgie/backports) will be uninstalled as part of the upgrade. Use budgie-welcome to reinstall anything that is removed.\n\n## HOW TO UPGRADE FROM 18.04.4\n\n18.04 LTS users using the 64bit edition will be offered the upgrade to 20.04 in July/August 2020 when the first point release (20.04.1) is made available. The first few months (April to July) are used to iron out those particularly troublesome issues not found at the initial release. So be patient and you will be rewarded with an upgrade window notification when to move to 20.04.\n\nThe Caffeine application indicator will be removed as part of the upgrade process. You can replace this with the native budgie caffeine applet in budgie-desktop-settings - panel - add applets\n\nTo get the 20.04 panel layout use the Menu - Budgie themes & Layouts application.\n\n18.04 LTS users using the 32bit edition cannot upgrade to 20.04 - 32bit support was dropped after 18.04.\n\nPlease refer to the community wiki for more help: [https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Upgrades](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Upgrades)Also, Ask Ubuntu has an excellent guide to help you upgrade: [http://askubuntu.com/questions/110477/how-do-i-upgrade-to-a-newer-version-of-ubuntu](http://askubuntu.com/questions/110477/how-do-i-upgrade-to-a-newer-version-of-ubuntu)\n\n# DOWNLOAD\n\nFinal release is available here: [https://ubuntubudgie.org/downloads/](https://ubuntubudgie.org/downloads/)Beta release is available here: [http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-budgie/releases/focal/beta/](http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-budgie/releases/focal/beta/)\n\n# GETTING SUPPORT\n\nThanks to the generosity of discourse.org, our support site is the crucial site for all things Ubuntu Budgie.\n\nOne to bookmark [https://discourse.ubuntubudgie.org](https://discourse.ubuntubudgie.org)More information can be found here.\n\n## INFRASTRUCTURE\n\nWe just wanted to thank our infrastructure sponsors who help us keep the lights on.\n\n[DIGITAL OCEAN](https://www.digitalocean.com/ \"DIGITAL\")\n\nOn a mission to simplify cloud computing so developers and their teams can spend more time building software that changes the world.\n\n[DISCOURSE](https://www.discourse.org/ \"DISCOURSE\")\n\nDiscourse is the 100% open source discussion platform built for the next decade of the Internet.

This time around the development has been fairly smooth and it should be straightforward for all distros uplifting to GNOME 3.36.\n\nUbuntu Budgie 20.04 LTS ships with budgie-desktop v10.5.1.\n\nThe following are the relevant sections from the [upstream release announcement](https://getsol.us/2019/10/03/budgie-and-its-army-of-gnomes/ \"upstream release announcement\").\n\n“Bug fixes are the cornerstone of Budgie 10.5 series releases, ensuring existing Budgie user experiences are smoother than ever.\n\nBudgie 10.5.1 has many bug fixes:\n\n- Classic Budgie Menu: Menu items are now sorted using locale linguist rules.\n- IconTasklist: Fixed instances of window tracking in multi-window scenarios\n- IconTasklist: Fixed the ability to move non-favourited running applications / windows in IconTasklist across grouping and non-grouping modes.\n- Raven: Notification body alignment is now properly justified.\n- Raven: Application controls in the Sound applet will now handle Gvc ChannelMap changes. This is useful since some applications do not provide accurate GvcStream volume immediately when creating their stream, such as Firefox when starting a video. Applications like Firefox more accurately reflect muted states over Gvc.\n- Polkit: Correctly handle user dismissing authentication dialogs\n- Window Manager: Enforced is an instant auto raise of windows when the focus-mode is set to mouse over / mouse focus and 250ms on click, resulting in speedy window raising.\n\nBudgie 10.5.1 introduces a few new goodies to make your Budgie experience even better!\n\n### Budgie Desktop Settings: Budgie Desktop Settings Fonts\n\nBudgie 10.5.1 introduces hinting and anti-aliasing settings in the Fonts section of Budgie Desktop Settings, allowing you even more flexibility with how document, interface, monospace, and window title fonts render:\n\n- For font hinting, you can choose between a range of options ranging from no font hinting to full font hinting.\n- For antialiasing, you can choose between subpixel antialiasing, standard grayscale, and no antialiasing.\n\n### Icon Tasklist Hover:\n\nIf you have a single window open for a given IconButton in the Icon Tasklist, the tooltip when you hover over is shown.\n\n### Workspaces:\n\nBudgie 10.5.1 introduces the ability to have persistent workspaces created at the launch of Budgie, with a configurable amount of default workspaces.\n\nUnder the Desktop section of Budgie Desktop Settings, you'll find a new option called “Number of virtual desktops”, where you can go from just having one workspace up to eight! A perfect opportunity to hide away all those Electron apps you're ashamed to be running!\n\nIf you want more workspaces dynamically, you can also use the Workspace Applet to add more as you need them.”\n\n### Ubuntu Budgie Experience\n\nThe following areas have been added or changed to enhance our budgie-desktop implementation:\n\n- System Tray applet now dropped as a default - it is buggy and the network manager applet is now/intended as a default\n- At the same time - added the ability to not run network-manager applet - this ensures the buggy system tray icon no longer appears\n- CTRL+ALT+left/right swaps workspaces without a workspace indicator in the middle of the screen. This has been done to speed up switching workspaces & most importantly removes the possibility of crashes due to conflicts with the workspace animations\n- Event alerts sounds are disabled by default now - if you want alert sounds choose the alert noise you want and sound level in Settings - Sound\n- HiDPI (4K) support for Budgie applets (both in built-in and third-party) and their popup functionality\n- Fix for keyboard shortcuts mysteriously going missing\n- Fix for multimonitors to stop windows overlapping the top-bar when maximised\n- Switch from qt5-style-plugins to qt5ct for QT app styling - apps such as vlc. You should see a QT5 Config app now in the menu to help you configure styling of QT apps. Also to note - some QT5 apps such as VLC also have styling options built in as well.\n- Moka based icons revised to capture GNOME 3.32/3.34 and 3.36 changes\n- Support large global menu in budgie-desktop panel\n- Better lock screen styling - buttons are now flat and match the lock screen dialog\n- Pixel Saver & Pocillo: Close button is now styled to match CSD windows\n\nNote also GNOME Upstream have now removed the split of Application Menus from the Window menu. So for Budgie this means there is no separate “Application” icon in the decoration to show the appmenu. Appmenus are now combined in the Window menu.\n\n## Desktop Layouts\n\nFor 20.04 LTS we now support a one click method to set up your desktop with a look and feel that you are most comfortable with.\n\n\\[caption id=\"attachment\\_1632\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"744\"\\]![Layouts](images/layouts-744x410.jpg) Layouts\\[/caption\\]\n\nAccessed through the Menu - Themes & Layouts, the following layouts can be used:\n\n- Traditional Budgie\n- Classic Ubuntu Budgie\n- Ubuntu Budgie\n- Cupertino\n- The One\n- redmond\n\nChoosing a layout replaces your current setup with a predefined panel and applet layout. Combine that with the theme makeover option, you now have a extremely fast method to configure Ubuntu Budgie the way you want to.\n\n## BUDGIE APPLETS & BUDGIE MINI-APPS\n\nDebuting for 20.04 are:\n\n### Budgie Applications Menu\n\nWe are pleased to ship by default our take on a simple but elegant menu for our desktop. Heavily based upon the good work of the ElementaryOS crew, this menu displays your installed applications via a Grid View as well as the traditional category view budgie users know and love.\n\n\\[caption id=\"attachment\\_1648\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"744\"\\]![Appscreen](images/appscreen-744x385.jpg) Desktop with Application Menu\\[/caption\\]\n\n… with powerstrip\n\n\\[caption id=\"attachment\\_1638\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"744\"\\]![Appmenu2](images/appmenu2-744x631.jpg) Menu with Powerstrip\\[/caption\\]\n\nWe have enhanced the menu to optionally show the budgie powerstrip - so for those users who dont want to use the default power applet in the panel. The menu has many extra features - e.g. right click action options for those applications live steam that offer them.\n\n\\[caption id=\"attachment\\_1637\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"744\"\\]![Appmenu3](images/appmenu3-744x637.jpg) Menu with application options\\[/caption\\]\n\n… a couple of hidden extras - type 2+2 - its a built in calculator or type ubuntubudgie.org into the search.\n\nAgain optionally - if you install zeitgeist the menu will start to learn what you frequently search for - and the search results be more tailored to your frequent requests - i.e. find things first time.\n\n### Network Manager Applet\n\nBudgie Desktop has shipped with a legacy network manager icon in the panel. It has never integrated very well - and together with the buggy system tray weird icon effects were visible on logon.\n\n\\[caption id=\"attachment\\_1630\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"303\"\\]![Nm1](images/nm1.jpg) Network Manager Applet\\[/caption\\]\n\nEnter the native Network Manager budgie applet. This integrates fully with our budgie desktop. We have tidied up and built upon the good work of the Daniel Pinto (original creator) and the ElementaryOS team from which the budgie-applet was derived from.\n\n### Budgie Window Shuffler\n\nFocal's Window Shuffler is a completely rewritten and re- designed version of Budgie's tiling add-on. Apart from the drastically improved responsiveness, features now include:\n\n- Setting margins and padding of the window grid \\[caption id=\"attachment\\_1629\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"600\"\\]![Shuff1](images/shuff1.jpg) Shuffler Preview\\[/caption\\]\n- Shortcuts for snapping windows to the nearest tile\n- Shortcuts for resizing windows in all directions\n- Scroll over the GUI grid to set its shade\n- Targeted position preview when using the GUI grid \\[caption id=\"attachment\\_1628\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"600\"\\]![Shuff2](images/shuff2.jpg) Shuffler: Preview\\[/caption\\]\n- Animated window movement when using shortcuts to move windows\n- Swapping windows in case a window is moved to an existing window's position\n- Shortcuts for Quarter / half tiling\n\nThe new Shuffler Control window \\[caption id=\"attachment\\_1627\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"744\"\\]![Shuff3](images/shuff3-744x660.jpg) Shuffler Controls\\[/caption\\]\n\n### Wallstreet\n\nOne request that continually was made was to have the ability to rotate through a folder full of photos and display on your desktop. We know there are many heavy-weight tools out there - but what our community wanted is a simple - very lightweight solution built into the desktop.\n\n\\[caption id=\"attachment\\_1625\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"535\"\\]![Wallstreet](images/wallstreet.jpg) Wallstreet Controls\\[/caption\\]\n\nEnter - WallStreet - a new lightweight wallpaper rotator every x minutes. Just enable it through the menu - wallstreet control\n\n### Visual-Space\n\nNew applet budgie-visualspace-applet - a stylish compact workspace switcher as a default on the panel.\n\n\\[caption id=\"attachment\\_1626\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"501\"\\]![Visualspace](images/visualspace.jpg) Visualspace\\[/caption\\]\n\nSo this desktop focused productivity tool is used if you have lots of windows spread over your desktop and/or between workspaces - you can quickly focus that window without having to alt-tab through everything.\n\n### Dropby\n\nDropby applet makes a reappearance as a default panel applet\n\n\\[caption id=\"attachment\\_1650\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"498\"\\]![Dropby](images/dropby-1.jpg) Dropby\\[/caption\\]\n\nWhen any USB device is connected then you have easy access to it - with the ability to copy its contents, open to see what is on it and to eject the device safely directly from a popup and panel applet.\n\n## Applet Updates\n\n- Application Indicator applet - don't show missing image icons for google hangouts extension i.e. Chrome/Chromium have now removed appindicator support\n- Weathershow applet - Display temperature correctly on vertical panels\n- Tweaked budgie-pixel-saver-applet to correctly handle displaying Titles/Titles & Buttons/Buttons\n\nAll these productivity applets and mini-apps are now available from Budgie Welcome - select Menu - Budgie Applets\n\nRemember, budgie-applets showcases many more indie developer applets\n\nIn total Ubuntu Budgie users have direct install access to 35 budgie applets and budgie mini-apps through budgie-welcome\n\nIf you want to showcase your applet in UB contact us and let us know about your project. Daily builds for budgie-extras is available - so to get the latest (warts and all) ppa:ubuntubudgie-dev/budgie-extras-daily\n\n## Budgie Welcome\n\n### Budgie Themes & Layouts\n\nWe have shipped for a few releases now the ability via one-click to completely update the look of your desktop - cursors, icons, themes etc. From 20.04, this makeover ability can now be individually applied i.e. just the theme, or icon etc. giving you an easy way to mix and match between different makeovers.\n\n\\[caption id=\"attachment\\_1631\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"744\"\\]![Makeover](images/makeover-744x407.jpg) Makeover\\[/caption\\]\n\nLatest version of vimix theme available through Menu - Budgie Themes & Layouts is shipped in 20.04 together with QogirBudgie (available by default on the installation)\n\n## Default Applications\n\n### Drawing\n\n\\[caption id=\"attachment\\_1635\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"683\"\\]![Drawing](images/drawing.jpg) Drawing\\[/caption\\]\n\nWe are pleased to ship by default the stylish new Drawing application. This application is a basic image editor, similar to Microsoft Paint, but aiming at the GNOME based desktops such as GNOME Shell and Budgie Desktop. PNG, JPEG and BMP format files are supported.\n\n### GNOME Firmware\n\nUbuntu Budgie now ships with GNOME Firmware - it is really a power user tool to resolve those specific vendor device issues that can be resolved by firmware. We don't expect you to generally use this to update stuff - only update if you are having issues that cannot be resolved by updating the linux kernel. Also to note - not all manufacturers release firmware that can be installed via linux - you may still have to resort to MS Windows based upgrades.\n\n### Celluloid\n\n\\[caption id=\"attachment\\_1636\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"744\"\\]![Celluloid](images/celluloid-744x482.jpg) Celluloid\\[/caption\\]\n\nCelluloid has now replaced gnome-mpv\n\n### Samba\n\nSamba has been removed as a default install\n\n### Android Phone integration\n\nUbuntu Budgie now provides seamless desktop-to/from-android phone transfer capabilities - we now ship with go-mtpfs by default. Simply plug-in your android phone and it will appear automatically in nemo allowing you to copy files/photos etc between your phone and the desktop.\n\n## KEY FEATURES AVAILABLE TO UB FROM UBUNTU\n\n- Linux kernel v5.4\n- GNOME 3.36 applications\n- Latest version of LibreOffice 6.4\n- Latest ZFS support with automatic APT rollback support\n- A shed-load of fixes throughout the Ubuntu stack - congrats on all Canonical, Ubuntu devs, Debian devs and all devs in the free software community for all of their hard-work which everyone should be pleased about ?\n- What does all that mean - most cutting edge yet stable software that brings great benefits for brand new hardware compatibility - including support for the very latest games.\n\n## UB MAINTAINED PACKAGES\n\nApart from the above (!) UB maintains many Debian packages. New versions available in 20.04 include:\n\n- Slick Greeter\n- Login Window Preferences\n- DesktopFolder\n\n## ISSUES RESOLVED:\n\n- Resolve the slow startup of QT based apps in 19.10.\n- Reduction of the number of error reports seen on logout and login\n- GNOME Software Updates tab has been hidden - it doesn’t really work and the recommended update process is via Menu - Software & Updates\n- Fixed budgie-desktop bug to allow custom layouts that include left & right panels.\n- Papercut - uninstalling default applets now no longer uninstalls the Ubuntu Budgie desktop environment.\n- F12 no longer launches Tilix - this was interfering with a common browser keyboard shortcut\n- Budgie Desktop now includes a patch developed by myself hopefully to reduce the number of crash reports you see on first logon.\n\n## KNOWN ISSUES:\n\n- When installed on default VirtualBox settings or QEMU, on first logon the session will crash when budgie-welcome is first open. The session also crashes when other applications such as Settings is open. [https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/xorg-server/+bug/1745345](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/xorg-server/+bug/1745345)\n- For virtualbox ensure the VMSVGA graphics driver is used in the virtual machine settings\n- For QEMU use the VMVGA graphics driver.\n- Alternatively for both uninstall the gstreamer1.0-vaapi package\n- If you find that after the upgrade clicking the menu button crashes the panel, then CTRL+ALT+T to open a terminal then run:\n- `nohup budgie-panel --reset --replace &`\n- Launching terminal based apps from the menu does not work. Workaround is to fool GLib to assume that a supported terminal (tilix isnt supported) is installed `sudo ln -s /usr/bin/tilix /usr/bin/nxterm`. [https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/budgie-desktop/+bug/1873428](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/budgie-desktop/+bug/1873428)\n\nPlease read the [Ubuntu Release](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/FocalFossa/ReleaseNotes \"Ubuntu Release\") notes which covers issues common to all Ubuntu Flavors.\n\n# UPGRADING\n\n## HOW TO UPGRADE FROM 18.10/19.04/19.10 TO 20.04\n\nIMPORTANT: remember to double-check you have the following vital package before you upgrade:\n\n```\nsudo apt install ubuntu-budgie-desktop\n```\n\nAfter the release of 20.04, you will be offered to upgrade when you run Software & Updates. Alternatively, from a command line run:\n\n```\nupdate-manager\n```\n\nIMPORTANT We do not recommend running `do-release-upgrade` from a Tilix terminal since this will hang during the upgrade. If you want to use do-release-upgrade switch to a TTY and login before running the command.\n\nSome of the packages that were installed as part of the Ubuntu Budgie backports PPA (ppa:ubuntubudgie/backports) will be uninstalled as part of the upgrade. Use budgie-welcome to reinstall anything that is removed.\n\n## HOW TO UPGRADE FROM 18.04.4\n\n18.04 LTS users using the 64bit edition will be offered the upgrade to 20.04 in July/August 2020 when the first point release (20.04.1) is made available. The first few months (April to July) are used to iron out those particularly troublesome issues not found at the initial release. So be patient and you will be rewarded with an upgrade window notification when to move to 20.04.\n\nThe Caffeine application indicator will be removed as part of the upgrade process. You can replace this with the native budgie caffeine applet in budgie-desktop-settings - panel - add applets\n\nTo get the 20.04 panel layout use the Menu - Budgie themes & Layouts application.\n\n18.04 LTS users using the 32bit edition cannot upgrade to 20.04 - 32bit support was dropped after 18.04.\n\nPlease refer to the community wiki for more help: [https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Upgrades](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Upgrades)Also, Ask Ubuntu has an excellent guide to help you upgrade: [http://askubuntu.com/questions/110477/how-do-i-upgrade-to-a-newer-version-of-ubuntu](http://askubuntu.com/questions/110477/how-do-i-upgrade-to-a-newer-version-of-ubuntu)\n\n# DOWNLOAD\n\nFinal release is available here: [https://ubuntubudgie.org/downloads/](https://ubuntubudgie.org/downloads/) Beta release is available here: [http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-budgie/releases/focal/beta/](http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-budgie/releases/focal/beta/)\n\n# GETTING SUPPORT\n\nThanks to the generosity of discourse.org, our support site is the crucial site for all things Ubuntu Budgie.\n\nOne to bookmark [https://discourse.ubuntubudgie.org](https://discourse.ubuntubudgie.org) More information can be found here.\n\n## INFRASTRUCTURE\n\nWe just wanted to thank our infrastructure sponsors who help us keep the lights on.\n\n[DIGITAL OCEAN](https://www.digitalocean.com/ \"DIGITAL OCEAN\") On a mission to simplify cloud computing so developers and their teams can spend more time building software that changes the world.\n\n[DISCOURSE](https://www.discourse.org/ \"DISCOURSE\") Discourse is the 100% open source discussion platform built for the next decade of the Internet.

The general tendency to add tiling features to the desktop environment is obvious, and we were pleased to get reports that shuffler also works well on Mate and GNOME Shell.\n\nThe tool was initially mainly oriented on -and written around- the grid- GUI. Much of the functionality _could_ be called from the keyboard (quarter/half tiling etc.) or from hot-corners via custom commands, but options to do so were not obvious to the average user. You had to read the Release notes to find out the correct keyboard combinations or cli commands.\n\nWhile generally all worked fine, there were a few weak spots to consider:\n\n- Due to the fact that it was written in Python, the code potentially suffered from a cold start, and the tool was kind of sluggish in some cases.\n- Having to call a GUI to arrange windows, shuffler presented itself as a separated tool rather than an integrated feature, and the GUI was an extra step in the workflow.\n\n## New Shuffler 2020\n\nAt the end of 2019 - beginning of 2020, the code was completely reorganized and rewritten in Vala. In the new design, a number of \"satellites\", executables performing their different tasks, are situated around the heart of shuffler: _shuffler-daemon_. This daemon takes care of all procedures that would normally suffer from a cold start, like pre-loading libraries, initiate calculations and maintain information to be available instantly via dbus calls. The separate executables furthermore share their functionality where possible and useful. The result is a prompt response on the keyboard, and a more flexible and scalable Shuffler. New Shuffler furthermore solved discover-ability by a new and easy to understand Shuffler Control Center via the menu, including an overview of all keyboard shortcuts.\n\nFrom a user's perspective, instead of being created around the GUI, the tool is now mainly oriented on controls by keyboard. The grid GUI (also redesigned and simplified) is an extra option on top of it, and a quick shortcut to define grid sizes.\n\nAlong With the rewrite, a number of new options and improvements was introduced, such as resizing in all directions from the keyboard, swapping window size & position, show warnings on attempts to resize below a window's minsize, \"sticky neighbors\" (resizing adjacent windows), options to use margins & padding etcetera.\n\n## Current development\n\nCurrent development again includes major extents to Shuffler's features. While Shuffler so far was mostly about straightforward tiling, moving & resizing, two of the latest additions make a slight flirt into the direction of automation:\n\n- **Shuffler window rules** - is the new option to make windows of a specific WM\\_CLASS (any) open on any position on any of the connected monitors.\n    \n    \\[video width=\"960\" height=\"540\" mp4=\"https://ubuntubudgie.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/rules2.mp4\"\\]\\[/video\\]\n    \n- **Shuffler Layouts** - is the new option to create predefined window layouts for a quick setup of the working environment (single click or keyboard press).\n    \n    \\[video width=\"960\" height=\"540\" mp4=\"https://ubuntubudgie.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/layout2.mp4\"\\]\\[/video\\]\n    \n\nBoth of these features are already programmed into shuffler, and can be manually managed (configuring files). Next challenge is to design a new control center, simple enough to understand quickly what is what, but still with all possibilities under the fingertips.\n\n## Community input!\n\nExactly the latter is where we'd love to have some input from the community. Although in general it might be safe to assume that mostly advanced users will be using more complex possibilities of tiling tools, we'd like to think it could save many users quite some time and effort to arrange their work environment. The aim of a new Shuffler Control Center is to make options and possibilities as obvious as they can be. We are inviting you to join us in the discussion on the outline of a new Shuffler Control Center. Please [join us on Discourse](https://discourse.ubuntubudgie.org/t/new-control-center-of-window-shuffler-share-your-thoughts/4167 \"join us on Discourse\") to do so!\n\nTo follow latest development on Shuffler on 20.04 and 20.10, add the ppa of Budgie extras daily:\n\n`sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntubudgie-dev/budgie-extras-daily`  \n`sudo apt-get update`","src/content/blog/2020/09/development-update-on-window-shuffler.md","39f2316481fc32d8",{"html":2063,"metadata":2064},"\u003Ch2 id=\"the-history\">The history\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Ubuntu Budgie’s \u003Ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ii4n8H4XEzc\" title=\"first edition\">first edition\u003C/a> of tiling tool Window Shuffler was written during spring of 2018.

You had to read the Release notes to find out the correct keyboard combinations or cli commands.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>While generally all worked fine, there were a few weak spots to consider:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>Due to the fact that it was written in Python, the code potentially suffered from a cold start, and the tool was kind of sluggish in some cases.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Having to call a GUI to arrange windows, shuffler presented itself as a separated tool rather than an integrated feature, and the GUI was an extra step in the workflow.\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ul>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"new-shuffler-2020\">New Shuffler 2020\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>At the end of 2019 - beginning of 2020, the code was completely reorganized and rewritten in Vala. In the new design, a number of “satellites”, executables performing their different tasks, are situated around the heart of shuffler: \u003Cem>shuffler-daemon\u003C/em>. This daemon takes care of all procedures that would normally suffer from a cold start, like pre-loading libraries, initiate calculations and maintain information to be available instantly via dbus calls. The separate executables furthermore share their functionality where possible and useful. The result is a prompt response on the keyboard, and a more flexible and scalable Shuffler. New Shuffler furthermore solved discover-ability by a new and easy to understand Shuffler Control Center via the menu, including an overview of all keyboard shortcuts.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>From a user’s perspective, instead of being created around the GUI, the tool is now mainly oriented on controls by keyboard. The grid GUI (also redesigned and simplified) is an extra option on top of it, and a quick shortcut to define grid sizes.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Along With the rewrite, a number of new options and improvements was introduced, such as resizing in all directions from the keyboard, swapping window size &#x26; position, show warnings on attempts to resize below a window’s minsize, “sticky neighbors” (resizing adjacent windows), options to use margins &#x26; padding etcetera.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"current-development\">Current development\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Current development again includes major extents to Shuffler’s features. While Shuffler so far was mostly about straightforward tiling, moving &#x26; resizing, two of the latest additions make a slight flirt into the direction of automation:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Shuffler window rules\u003C/strong> - is the new option to make windows of a specific WM_CLASS (any) open on any position on any of the connected monitors.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>[video width=“960” height=“540” mp4=“\u003Ca href=\"https://ubuntubudgie.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/rules2.mp4%22%5C%5D%5C%5B/video%5C\">https://ubuntubudgie.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/rules2.mp4”\\]\\[/video\\\u003C/a>]\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Shuffler Layouts\u003C/strong> - is the new option to create predefined window layouts for a quick setup of the working environment (single click or keyboard press).\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>[video width=“960” height=“540” mp4=“\u003Ca href=\"https://ubuntubudgie.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/layout2.mp4%22%5C%5D%5C%5B/video%5C\">https://ubuntubudgie.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/layout2.mp4”\\]\\[/video\\\u003C/a>]\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ul>\n\u003Cp>Both of these features are already programmed into shuffler, and can be manually managed (configuring files).

Long Term Releases such as 20.04.1 provide assured stability over a longer term (3 yrs) than a standard 9 month release. Critical and stability fixes will be released for all the supported Ubuntu Budgie components; these will be undertaken by ourselves, Canonical and the wider Ubuntu community.\n\nIn these release notes the areas covered are:\n\n- New features and enhancements\n- Upgrading from 20.04.1 Ubuntu Budgie\n- Known Issues when upgrading\n- Where to download Ubuntu Budgie\n\n\\[caption id=\"attachment\\_1756\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"744\"\\]![Ub Desktop 2004](images/ub_desktop_2004-744x393.jpg) UB Desktop\\[/caption\\]\n\n([Download of Screenshot](https://github.com/UbuntuBudgie/assets/blob/master/Screenshots/20.10/default_desktop.png \"Download of Screenshot\"))\n\n## Summary\n\nUbuntu Budgie is the sum of many hundreds of developers working together.  \nFor 20.10 your Ubuntu Budgie team have concentrated on paper-cuts - tidying up the rough areas reported by you our community. That's not to say we as a team haven't had some fun as well!\n\nShuffler has had some nice touches including the funky sounding sticky neighbours and also a full CLI to allow the tinkers to fully customise their application arrangements.\n\nOur application menu now leverages the search facility to find the various parts of GNOME Settings. Many icons previously displayed are now stripped out allowing quicker visual access to applications. Also, look out for the optional rollover capability now in the category view.\n\nWe now include a full Mac like makeover using the fabulous Mojave theme and icons though a click of a button. This is also available to 20.04 LTS.\n\nAlso, we have developed an optional applet to replace the menu to present a full-screen application icons display based on a new project called lightpad. This is also available to 20.04 LTS.\n\n![full screen launcher](images/image-1601417534370.png)\n\nMuch of the bug-fixes have already been backported to our 20.04 LTS users. We will be continuing to rollout fixes throughout the LTS 3 year cycle.\n\nTaken together, all the smaller changes plus the larger enhancements shapes our distro to be fully flexible and customisable to your workflow; with sane defaults to provide a first rate experience from the get-go.\n\n## BUDGIE DESKTOP:\n\nOnce again Ubuntu Budgie continues to take the lead to ensure budgie desktop remains compatible with the latest GNOME stack. This time around the development has been fairly smooth and it should be straightforward for all distros uplifting to GNOME 3.38.\n\n1. Ubuntu Budgie 20.10 ships with a git release of budgie-desktop v10.5.1 which includes everything up-to the 20.10 freeze date.\n2. Patch created to allow you to choose which screenshot app to be invoked when pressing Print, Ctrl Print, Alt Print - dconf-editor is used to change the app\n3. Being a good contributor - we have upstream'd to the budgie-desktop project several 20.04 patches we have developed (Wnck crash, gnome-shell/budgie-desktop conflict as well as the ability to define the print button screenshot app)\n4. Fix created and pull-request made to allow non Latin keyboard layouts from the keyboard applet (to be backported to 20.04)\n5. Started looking at introducing compatibility with GNOME3.38 which will be on 20.10. PR made upstream\n6. Wallpaper changing now respects the animation flag - so if you turn of animations, changing wallpapers occur instantaneously\n7. Fix occasional crash when removing applets from a panel\n8. Upstream has resolved system tray icons breaking on login, resume from suspension\n9. Upstream has resolved Spotify cover art not displaying in raven\n10. Upstream: chromium browser based notifications now display their icons\n11. Upstream has enabled creating new instances of windows via middle click of icon task list applet\n12. Upstream has completely reworked the system tray. This resolves lots of issues including icons appearing to overlap each other.\n13. In raven we display week-numbers by default for the calendar\n14. Patch added to hide the \"Default\" theme in budgie-desktop-settings which is the Debian specific name for \"Adwaita\"\n\n## Budgie Applets and mini-apps\n\n1. Hotcorners: Option added to configure hotcorners via budgie-desktop-settings and therefore hide the icon from the panel\n2. Dropby: Applet settings now has the ability to display the USB window notification in any corner you define\n\n![file](images/image-1601319520268.png)\n\n3. Dropby: Animation when copying media so that you now when copying is in progress/finished\n4. Dropby: Crash reports resolved when second user account uses dropby on same machine (also backported to 20.04)\n5. Application Menu: Touch Screen friendly - can now swipe on your touchscreen\n6. Application Menu: Better keyboard navigation from the search to categories etc.\n7. Application Menu: Search bar changes position to the bottom when on a bottom panel\n\n![file](images/image-1601319422398.png)\n\n5. Application Menu: Hide the large number of Settings menu icons shown in the grid view and the System Tools category menu - its more elegant this way - use the search capabilities to find Settings options like bluetooth and sharing etc.\n6. Application Menu: In a similar fashion the logout/restart/suspend/shutdown icons have now been removed. Search actions are now available for these + the ability to \"lock\" the screen when searching and \"hibernate\" if you have enabled hibernation separately\n7. Application Menu: Mouse rollover capability in the category view is now available via applet settings\n8. Application Menu: Handling of fractions should be better and more intuitive (e.g. 5.3\\*0.5 in the search bar)\n9. Application Menu - Category view - styled as a sidebar now\n10. Previews: auto close when app loses focus (also backported to 20.04)\n11. Previews: enable/disabling the capability is now dynamic - there is no need to logout/login\n12. Previews: Multiple Libreoffice windows are previewed correctly to allow switching (also backported to 20.04)\n13. Previews: now displays a tooltip on mouse hover (configurable) to show the full window name\n14. Previews - no longer crashes when there are no windows and you invoke alt+tab multiple times (to be backported to 20.04)\n15. Network: left/right panels do not have a large space when applet placed in end section. (also backported to 20.04)\n16. Network: VPNs listed are now alphabetically sorted to make things easier to find the right VPN (also backported to 20.04)\n17. Brightness Controller applet: Fix to make slider actually work. Should now work against a GNOME 3.36 base (also backported to 20.04)\n18. Window Shuffler - enable/disabling the capability is now dynamic - there is no need to logout/login\n19. Window Shuffler Sticky Neighbours - new capability to resize adjacent windows automatically\n\n[![](images/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6mrrVpE5A0) (click to launch YouTube video)\n\n9. Window Shuffler - feedback when trying to tile windows that have a minimum size bigger than the tile placement\n10. Window Shuffler - add CLI option to place apps to any tile position. This allows everyone to script their launch and placement setup\n11. Welcome Layouts - global menu occasionally crashes the panel when using cupertino/theone layouts. For these we now re-enable the nemo menu - for other layouts we hide the menu (remember to use Alt to show the menu) (also backported to 20.04)\n12. Made more distro friendly: Some distros don't use some stuff located in /usr/bin and other file locations. We have now reworked the vala applets/mini apps to compile to user-defined system locations (i.e. via meson --bindir --sysconfdir --prefix --libdir)\n13. Countdown: This applet is now vertical panel friendly with icons and text respecting the space available on vertical panels (also backported to 20.04)\n14. General: Latest translations from the Transifex team - more help wanted [https://www.transifex.com/ubuntu-budgie/ubuntu-budgie-extras](https://www.transifex.com/ubuntu-budgie/ubuntu-budgie-extras) (also backported to 20.04)\n15. New applet: Desktop fullscreen applauncher called budgie-lightpad-applet\n16. budgie-workspace-wallpaper-applet has been rewritten in Vala. This has been done primarily to ensure no inadvertent panel crashes. In addition it takes into account the budgie desktop changes we made to switch wallpapers almost instantaneously (without animation) when switching workspaces.\n17. WeatherShow - add the ability to display a custom location for the weather city\n18. QuickChar - don't crash when run on Wayland based desktops.\n\n## Budgie Welcome\n\n![file](images/image-1601319553499.png)\n\n1. Extras - rename \"Applets\" to Extras to better reflect the types of things that can be installed\n2. Extras - Instructions on how to enable applets after install displayed immediately next to the install button when invoked.\n3. Extras - All window previews to be uninstalled\n4. Add Budgie Lightpad Applet installable for 18.04 and later\n5. Themes - Corrected picture sizing to be identical for all themes\n6. Themes - Allow users of the vimix makeover to install individual parts\n7. Themes - Latest Upstream Paper theme has now removed Paper cursors - so rework to remove this from makeover\n8. Mojave theme/icons and font makeover is now available in budgie-welcome. This has been backported to 20.04 as well ![file](images/image-1601055802227.png)\n9. Getting Started - point to the correct YouTube video for Shuffler\n10. Getting Started - Corrected 20.04 keyboard shortcut to launch Shuffler\n11. Getting Started - Added Brave Browser to the browser ballot\n12. Getting Started - fixed bug where translated topics had an apostrophe which caused the topic not to respond to a click to display the topic.\n13. General - Latest translations - more help wanted!

Arc-Theme has now been updated - the maintainer has changed to [https://github.com/jnsh/arc-theme](https://github.com/jnsh/arc-theme). The theme now has an additional theme called Arc-Lighter. Do give some feedback especially about anything budgie related to the new maintainer - do give thanks to the new maintainer taking on this challenge.\n2. Paper-Theme updated to the latest upstream version\n3. Pocillo-Theme - all the deprecated SASS code has been fixed. This future proofs the theme. Any help - large or small is welcome. **Join the UB team** by becoming the pocillo theme dedicated maintainer! [https://github.com/UbuntuBudgie/pocillo-gtk-theme](https://github.com/UbuntuBudgie/pocillo-gtk-theme)\n4. QogirBudgie-Theme - all the deprecated SASS code has been fixed. This future proofs the theme. Any issues - please raise to [https://github.com/vinceliuice/Qogir-theme](https://github.com/vinceliuice/Qogir-theme)\n5. QogirTheme - as requested by the community, the highlight focus colour has changed from Ubuntu Orange to Standard Blue.\n\n## Additional\n\n1. All packages are now arm64 available. This means you can now use [desktopify](https://github.com/wimpysworld/desktopify \"desktopify\") and create a Raspi v4 Ubuntu Budgie image ![file](images/image-1601318519372.png)\n2. gedit text edit highlight for current line turned off. Dark themes are broken with gedit and often the text color cannot be read.\n3. New option \"Align to grid\" when right click the desktop - this switches on the desktop grid mode. Note there will now be a \"Customise\" right click menu option available when you choose Align to grid and this can be used to customise the grid including turning off/on the icon auto-arrangement\n4. We now ship with our own file extension handling list of apps e.g. picture files should open in the viewer gthumb and .deb should open in gnome-software\n5. We now disable the nemo behaviour where a double-click in an empty area would go up one folder\n6. We enable default in nemo to allow a slow doubleclick on filename to rename a file\n7. The Ubuntu Budgie team choice wallpapers are now available in 20.10. Enjoy!\n8. Nemo - Enforce asking when deleting and moving to trash so that inadvertent deleting files is not possible\n9. Slick-greeter is part of the packages UB maintains - this has now been updated to the very latest available. So check that all is well.\n10. lightdm-settings (the companion to slick-greeter) is part of the packages UB maintains - this has now been updated to the very latest available. So check that all is well.\n11. All the backport packages have now been rebuilt for groovy - both amd64 and arm64 architectures.\n12. Both nemo-share and nemo-dropbox backport packages have been rebuilt from the upstream v4.6.0 package\n13. For new accounts/new installs, gnome-software no longer autostarts. This reduces the memory desktop usage by approx 100-150Mb. You'll see an autostart entry in your autostart list - don't worry, this is just to stop the autostart running for budgie-desktop - but runs correctly for GNOME Shell/Unity desktops.\n\n## KEY FEATURES AVAILABLE TO UB FROM UBUNTU\n\n- - - Linux kernel v5.8\n        - GNOME 3.38 applications\n        - Latest version of LibreOffice 7\n        - GRUB2 is used to boot the ISO both in legacy and UEFI mode\n\n![file](images/image-1601318438244.png)\n\n- - - What does all that mean - most cutting edge yet stable software that brings great benefits for brand new hardware compatibility - including support for the very latest games.\n\n## UB MAINTAINED PACKAGES\n\nApart from the above (!) UB maintains many Debian packages. New versions available in 20.10 include:\n\n- - - Slick Greeter\n        - Login Window Preferences\n        - DesktopFolder\n        - Arc Theme\n\n## KNOWN ISSUES\n\n- Windows flicker when [resizing](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/mutter/+bug/1896627 \"resizing\"). We recommend trying to use the TearFree intel.conf method described by this [answer](https://askubuntu.com/a/1119262/14356 \"answer\").\n- Broadcom BCMWL driver fails to [load](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/bcmwl/+bug/1878045 \"load\") i.e. no wifi capabilities\n- various reports that the ISO does not boot/install grub. The boot capabilities which includes introducing GRUB2 in legacy booting has caused a few instances where the ISO does not boot or not able to boot after installation. Do remember to report these issues to launchpad so that these edge cases are found and hopefully resolved as we near release day in October.\n- If you find that after the upgrade clicking the menu button crashes the panel, then CTRL+ALT+T to open a terminal then run:\n- `nohup budgie-panel --reset --replace &`\n- Launching terminal based apps from the menu does not work. Workaround is to fool GLib to assume that a supported terminal (tilix isnt supported) is installed `sudo ln -s /usr/bin/tilix /usr/bin/nxterm`.

If you want to use `do-release-upgrade` switch to a TTY and login before running the command.\n\nSome of the packages that were installed as part of the Ubuntu Budgie backports PPA (ppa:ubuntubudgie/backports) will be uninstalled as part of the upgrade. Use budgie-welcome to reinstall anything that is removed.\n\n* * *\n\nPlease refer to the community wiki for more help:\n\n[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Upgrades](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Upgrades)\n\nAlso, Ask Ubuntu has an excellent guide to help you upgrade:\n\n[http://askubuntu.com/questions/110477/how-do-i-upgrade-to-a-newer-version-of-ubuntu](http://askubuntu.com/questions/110477/how-do-i-upgrade-to-a-newer-version-of-ubuntu)\n\n# DOWNLOAD\n\nFinal release is available here: [https://ubuntubudgie.org/downloads/](https://ubuntubudgie.org/downloads/)\n\n# GETTING SUPPORT\n\nThanks to the generosity of discourse.org, our support site is the crucial site for all things Ubuntu Budgie.\n\nOne to bookmark [https://discourse.ubuntubudgie.org](https://discourse.ubuntubudgie.org)\n\nMore information can be found [here](https://ubuntubudgie.org/2018/03/08/welcome-to-discourse/).\n\n## INFRASTRUCTURE\n\nWe just wanted to thank our infrastructure sponsors who help us keep the lights on.\n\n### [DIGITAL OCEAN](https://www.digitalocean.com/)\n\nOn a mission to simplify cloud computing so developers and their teams can spend more time building software that changes the world.\n\n### [DISCOURSE](https://www.discourse.org/)\n\nDiscourse is the 100% open source discussion platform built for the next decade of the Internet.

If you need Long Term Support, it is recommended you use Ubuntu 18.04 LTS instead.\n\nIn these release notes the areas covered are:\n\n- New features and enhancements\n- Issues Resolved\n- Upgrading from 18.04 / 18.10 Ubuntu Budgie\n- Known Issues when upgrading\n- Where to download Ubuntu Budgie\n\n\u003C!--more-->\n\n# NEW FEATURES AND ENHANCEMENTS\n\n## 18.10 STUFF CARRIED THROUGH TO 19.04\n\n- Firefox is the default browser. So out goes a chromium-browser icon on both the icon-task-list and plank dock - in comes Firefox\n- For good measure, we have added ubuntu budgie welcome as a default program icon to make discovery instant (on both the icon-task-list and plank dock).\n- We have dropped TLP from the default install. The power savings in the kernel from kernel 4.18 and later are significant for newer computers. TLP is still available to be installed if the kernel power savings do not impact you due to using an older CPU.\n- The caffeine appindicator has been dropped - this has been replaced with the native caffeine budgie-applet that comes with budgie-desktop v10.5\n- We've added a new game 2048 as part of the default install - a great way to while away a few hours\n\n## 19.04 STUFF TO LOOK OUT FOR\n\n- New default wallpaper\n\n![Desktop]\n\n- Fonts have changed from \"Ubuntu\" to \"Noto Sans\" except for the terminal font since Ubuntu is much easier to read!\n- Ubuntu Budgie Team Wallpapers for 19.04 - the UB team has decided for this release to choose their favourite wallpapers - quite an eclectic bunch. I hope you like them.

These are three critical applets and should never be removed manually. They don't need to be added to a panel though.\n\n**In total Ubuntu Budgie users have direct install access to 28 applets through budgie-welcome**\n\nIf you want to showcase your applet in UB contact us and let us know about your project.\n\n- Daily builds for budgie-extras is now available - so to get the latest (warts and all) ppa:ubuntubudgie-dev/budgie-extras-daily\n\n# KEY FEATURES AVAILABLE TO UB FROM UBUNTU\n\n- Linux kernel v5\n- GNOME 3.32 applications - all apps need regression testing\n- Latest version of LibreOffice 6.2\n- Fractional Display scaling is an experimental option:\n\ngsettings set org.gnome.mutter experimental-features \"\\\n\nThen use Settings - Displays to set the scale 1, 1.25 etc.\n\n- Live Patch is available directly from the menu although the capability is only applicable to LTS users; so this is prep work for 20.04LTS\n- A shed-load of fixes throughout the Ubuntu stack - congrats on all Canonical, Ubuntu devs, Debian devs and all devs in the free software community for all of their hard-work which everyone should be pleased about :)\n\nWhat does all that mean - most cutting edge yet stable software that brings great benefits for brand new hardware compatibility - including support for the very latest games.\n\n# UB MAINTAINED PACKAGES\n\nApart from the above (!) UB maintains many Debian packages. New versions available in 19.04 include:\n\n- rhythmbox-plugin-alternative-toolbar\n- slick-greeter\n- Arc-Theme\n\n# ISSUES RESOLVED:\n\n- bug-fix to sweep up default install icons that are not Moka based - so applications have renamed their icon names, so Moka needs to keep up\n- Workspace switching stopped working in 18.10 - the previously manual dconf fix is now in 19.04\n- 19.04 minimal installs - gnome-online-accounts work out of the box\n- Window animations have been re-enabled. Check that in budgie-desktop-settings - style that animations is enabled.\n\n# KNOWN ISSUES:\n\n- If you find that after the upgrade clicking the menu button crashes the panel, then CTRL+ALT+T to open a terminal then run:\n\n```\nnohup budgie-panel --reset --replace &\n```\n\n- Desktop Icons/ Nemo Folders on the upgrade to 19.04 from 18.10.\n    - Desktop icons will not carry over its position from 18.10 - remember this is very different software. So you will need to rearrange your desktop again.\n    - Icon-view Folder icon sizes are different between Nautilus and Nemo. You will need to use the zoom capability to see what works for you.\n    - The default version of Nemo is 3.8.5. The spacing between icons is much larger than we have been used to with Nautilus. V4 that is available in backports somewhat resolves this issue.\n    - On upgrade from 18.10 you may have both Nautilus and Nemo installed. You can safely remove nautilus via `sudo apt purge nautilus`.\n    - on upgrade if you have an icon shortcut in either Plank or the icon-tasklist applet for Nautilus you will need to undock/unpin and redock/repin Nemo (unless of course you still want to continue using Nautilus)\n- Please read the [Ubuntu Release notes](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DiscoDingo/ReleaseNotes) which covers issues common to all Ubuntu Flavors\n\n# UPGRADING\n\n## HOW TO UPGRADE FROM 18.10 TO 19.04\n\n**IMPORTANT:** remember to double-check you have the following vital package before you upgrade:\n\n```\nsudo apt install ubuntu-budgie-desktop\n```\n\nAfter the release of 19.04, you will be offered to upgrade when you run Software & Updates.\n\nAlternatively, from a command line run:\n\n```\nupdate-manager\n```\n\n**IMPORTANT** We do not recommend running `do-release-upgrade` from a Tilix terminal since this will hang during the upgrade. If you want to use `do-release-upgrade` switch to a TTY and login before running the command.\n\nSome of the packages that were installed as part of the Ubuntu Budgie backports PPA (ppa:ubuntubudgie/backports) will be uninstalled as part of the upgrade. Use budgie-welcome to reinstall anything that is removed.\n\n## HOW TO UPGRADE FROM 18.04 TO 19.04\n\nShort story - you cannot directly upgrade. You must first [upgrade](https://ubuntubudgie.org/blog/2018/09/27/18-10-release-notes) to 18.10 before upgrading to 19.04. Anything else is not supported nor supportable.\n\n* * *\n\nPlease refer to the community wiki for more help:\n\n[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Upgrades](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Upgrades)\n\nAlso, Ask Ubuntu has an excellent guide to help you upgrade:\n\n[http://askubuntu.com/questions/110477/how-do-i-upgrade-to-a-newer-version-of-ubuntu](http://askubuntu.com/questions/110477/how-do-i-upgrade-to-a-newer-version-of-ubuntu)\n\n# DOWNLOAD\n\nFinal release & Dailies are found here:\n\n[https://ubuntubudgie.org/downloads](https://ubuntubudgie.org/downloads)\n\n# GETTING SUPPORT\n\nThanks to the generosity of discourse.org, our support site is the crucial site for all things Ubuntu Budgie.\n\nOne to bookmark [https://discourse.ubuntubudgie.org](https://discourse.ubuntubudgie.org/)\n\nMore information can be found [here](https://ubuntubudgie.org/blog/2018/03/08/welcome-to-discourse).\n\n# INFRASTRUCTURE\n\nWe just wanted to thank our infrastructure sponsors who help us keep the lights on.\n\n### [DIGITAL OCEAN](https://www.digitalocean.com/)\n\nOn a mission to simplify cloud computing so developers and their teams can spend more time building software that changes the world.\n\n### [DISCOURSE](https://www.discourse.org/)\n\nDiscourse is the 100% open source discussion platform built for the next decade of the Internet.

We have met several goals this year and including our stretch goal:\n\n- LTS Fiscal Goal - ensure that the costs to support a three-year LTS were in place.\n- Contribute on behalf of the Ubuntu Budgie community - a financial contribution for 2017 was donated to the Solus community since Solus provides much of the development behind the Budgie Desktop. Solus themeselves stopped donations in 2018. We will keep reserves available if and when Solus restart donation receipts.\n- Stretch Goal - ensure we have reserves to meet five years of costs (2019 - 2023).\n\n**Operating Costs**\n\n- Infrastructure costs relating to the website, test build servers, domain registrations\n- Reserves are in place as a contingency to account for unexpected expenses.\n\n**[Donations](https://ubuntubudgie.org/it-s-all-thanks-to-you)**\n\n_Patreon_\n\nFor 2018-2019 we did have a handful of **Patreon** donors. Please do consider becoming a **Patreon** since this gives Ubuntu Budgie a regular income.\n\n_PayPal_\n\nWe have had many individuals who donate via **Paypal**, and we thank you all!\n\n**Sponsorship**\n\n_Digital Ocean_\n\nWe have had a significant vote of confidence by **DigitalOcean** paying for all of our 2017/2018 hosting and infrastructure fees and we hope to continue our partnership through the 2019-2020 fiscal year as well. [https://www.digitalocean.com](https://www.digitalocean.com)\n\n_Discourse_\n\nLast year we moved our community over to a discourse forum which was generously provided through sponsorship as well. [https://www.discourse.org/](https://www.discourse.org/)\n\n_Status.io_\n\nWhile this is yet to be implemented on our part, Status.io has provided a sponsorship that will help us keep our community up to date with system interruptions in our infrastructure. [https://status.io](https://status.io)\n\n**Partnerships**\n\nBriefly, we have explored a partnership with Tuxedo Computers to see computers with Ubuntu Budgie preinstalled on systems. Discussion is ongoing.\n\n**Future Goals**\n\nLast year we set our sights this year to meet two very sizable cost goals; looking to fund equipment with HiDPI capability and with multiple HiDPI monitors. We recognise that more and more of our community use multi monitors and increasingly with HiDPI type resolutions. Through your contributions we have enough money to purchase a couple of HiDPI monitors.\n\n**Contributions**\n\n- This year our community has contributed £2919.\n- We have a nominal £3477.33 in the bank, with set-aside costs for 2019 to 2023 + reserves.\n\nOur confidence level for our financial viability is as close to 100% as you can get.\n\nAs a comparison:\n\n- 2016-2017, our community contributed £248.90 with no set-aside costs and no reserves\n- 2017-2018, our community contributed £2460 with set-aside costs for 2018 to 2022 + reserves\n\n* * *\n\nWith your help, we look forward to making more donations to developers and organisations who have helped Ubuntu Budgie.\n\n* * *\n\n**The Team**\n\nAll Ubuntu Budgie team members including myself are volunteers. At this point we the team do not benefit financially in anyway from your generosity. If we had one or more full-time developers, then the speed of development and improvement would be exponentially higher. For this to become fiscally possible, the project would need to grow to approx 10x the current contribution rate to achieve that.\n\n**Canonical Support**\n\nAlthough we are an official flavour of the Ubuntu Family, we do not receive any financial help from Canonical. Canonical supports Ubuntu Budgie through their launchpad build systems and ISO distribution costs.\n\n* * *\n\n**Thank You**\n\nAll donors are displayed on our website unless you specifically request not to be presented.\n\n**Donations**\n\nIf you would like to [support Ubuntu Budgie](@page/5), please feel free to donate to the project through either **Paypal** or **Patreon**.\n\nThank you to all who have chosen to join our community.\n\nDavid (project lead)","src/content/blog/2019/04/ubuntu-budgie-annual-financial-statement-2018-2019.md","8a703732a881035a",{"html":2245,"metadata":2246},"\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Summary\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>As part of our commitment to be transparent with the community, the team is pleased to present a short statement of our financial position covering 2018 to 2019.\u003C/p>\n\u003C!--more-->\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>History\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>Budgie Remix had launched in April 2016\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>In Nov 2016 Ubuntu Budgie was granted the status as an official community flavour with Ubuntu/Canonical.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>17.04 was our first release “official” release as a flavour.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>18.04 was our first Long Term Schedule release\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ul>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Goals\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>As we close off our fiscal year for 2019 (Apr 2018 - Mar 31, 2019), the financial position of the project is very healthy.

If you need Long Term Support, it is recommended you use Ubuntu 18.04 LTS instead.\n\nIn these release notes the areas covered are:\n\n- New features and enhancements\n- Issues Resolved\n- Upgrading from 18.04 / 18.10 / 19.04 Ubuntu Budgie\n- Known Issues when upgrading\n- Where to download Ubuntu Budgie\n\n\u003C!--more-->\n\n# NEW FEATURES AND ENHANCEMENTS\n\n## 19.10 STUFF TO LOOK OUT FOR\n\n- Ubuntu Budgie Team Wallpapers for 19.10 - the UB team has decided for this release to choose their favourite wallpapers - quite an eclectic bunch. I hope you like them. We will next run a community contest for the 20.04 LTS\n- All our backport packages have now been rebuilt for 19.10 - look out for nemo 4, nemo-share and nemo-dropbox and also skippy-xd is available through backports.\n- Budgie Welcome - Translation team has been bustling - many more languages now available\n- Latest versions of our default themes Pocillo, QogirBudgie and Arc\n- Budgie Appindicators now deal with shrinking panel sizes\n\n## BUDGIE DESKTOP:\n\nOnce again Ubuntu Developers (thanks Marco Trevisan) & Ubuntu Budgie continues to take the lead to ensure budgie desktop remains compatible with the latest GNOME stack. This time around the development ride has been particularly rough but I've worked with the GNOME mutter developers to ensure a smooth ride for all distros uplifting to GNOME 3.34.\n\nI've added the following enhancements:\n\n- patch to bring support for nemo-desktop and DesktopFolder to budgie desktop settings.\n- ability to increase the spacer applet sizing without impacting the overall size of the panel.\n- sort the menu taking into account your user locale characters such as accents\n- ability to launch applications from the menu requiring elevated privileges\n- hopefully reduced the occasional budgie desktop based apport dialogs seen during logon\n\nAlso have pulled from upstream a Fonts DPI configuration option in budgie desktop settings.\n\n### ACCESSIBILITY\n\nWe have taken a closer look at making our distro more easy to use for those of us who need just a little extra help. This is where we need your help. What tricks & techniques are you aware of that helps improve the accessibility of the desktop?\n\nWe have incorporated a super useful screen magnifier - just enable via the Settings - Accessibility options\n\nBind both Super + Alt + = and Super + Alt + + as zoom-in keys\n\n![Magni](images/magni.png)\n\nAlso we have included the on-screen keyboard (onboard)\n\n![](images/onboard.png)\n\n### NVIDIA\n\nOur 19.10 distro now includes the NVIDIA proprietary driver sets on its ISO. This allows NVIDIA users to install & configure drivers out of the box without needing an internet connection. Just click the wifi installer option to install the correct NVIDIA driver for your computer - obviously assuming that your hardware needs it.\n\nLikewise, we have added support for Optimus graphics switching direct from the budgie panel. If you have Optimus graphics look for the intel/nvidia icon to switch between your intel & nvidia GPUs.\n\n\u003Cfigure>\n\n![Nvidia Menu](images/nvidia_menu.png)\n\n\u003Cfigcaption>\n\nNvidia Menu\n\n\u003C/figcaption>\n\n\u003C/figure>\n\n### ZFS\n\nWe are pleased to support [Ubuntu's ZFS initiative](https://ubuntu.com/blog/enhancing-our-zfs-support-on-ubuntu-19-10-an-introduction). For Ubuntu Budgie, you will have the option to [install the ZFS file-system](https://didrocks.fr/2019/10/11/ubuntu-zfs-support-in-19.10-zfs-on-root/) from the ISO\n\n![Zfs](images/ZFS.jpg)\n\nRemember this is experimental - so don't use on a valuable production system. Canonical devs are very interested in feedback - so this is an easy way to help-out early with 20.04LTS development.\n\nYou will need a minimum of 4GB RAM to install ZFS - don't use on RAM limited systems.\n\n## BUDGIE APPLETS & BUDGIE MINI-APPS\n\nDebuting for 19.10 are Window Previews, QuickChar, FuzzyClock, Workspace Stopwatch, Budgie Brightness Controller and Budgie Status-Notifier\n\n### WINDOW PREVIEWS\n\nWindow previews (Alt Tab replacement) has been rewritten in vala - faster with per workspace/all workspaces and shift backwards controls. Additionally, Alt Above-Tab shows windows of the currently active application only.\n\n![Previews](images/previews.png)\n\nEnable through Menu - Previews Control\n\n### QUICKCHAR MINI APP\n\nQuickly find and choose the equivalent locale character for an ascii character\n\nPress Super+Alt+C to call the window\n\nType a character, and all its derivates will appear. Click one (or tab to the targeted character and press Return) and the character will be pasted into the document\n\nPress again to toggle visibility, or Escape to hide\n\n![Chars](images/chars.png)\n\nInstall via Menu - Budgie Applets\n\n### FUZZYCLOCK APPLET\n\nShows the time in a Fuzzy Way.\n\nSupports 24-hour format Supports Dates Supports Horizontal Panels\n\n\u003Cfigure>\n\n![Fuzzy](images/fuzzy.png)\n\n\u003Cfigcaption>\n\nFuzzy\n\n\u003C/figcaption>\n\n\u003C/figure>\n\nThis is a new applet contributed by community member Adam Dyess - Thanks Adam!\n\nInstall via Menu - Budgie Applets\n\n### WORKSPACE STOPWATCH APPLET\n\nWorkspace Timer Applet is an applet to keep track of usage per workspace, e.g. to find out how much minutes/hours were actually spent on a job.

Very nice!\n\n![Ubuntubudgie19.10 On Qemu Kvm 045](images/ubuntubudgie19.10-on-QEMU-KVM_045.png)\n\n- Latest version of LibreOffice 6.3\n- A shed-load of fixes throughout the Ubuntu stack - congrats on all Canonical, Ubuntu devs, Debian devs and all devs in the free software community for all of their hard-work which everyone should be pleased about :)\n\nWhat does all that mean - most cutting edge yet stable software that brings great benefits for brand new hardware compatibility - including support for the very latest games.\n\n## UB MAINTAINED PACKAGES\n\nApart from the above (!) UB maintains many Debian packages. New versions available in 19.10 include:\n\n- slick-greeter\n- Arc-Theme\n- DesktopFolder\n\n## ISSUES RESOLVED:\n\n- Budgie Pixel Saver has been fixed to work with newer versions of mutter.\n- Appindicator applet now ignores right-click events; this is now consistent with all budgie applets and prevents confusion between left/right click events.\n- Out of the box we are now Python 2 free - better security especially due to the imminent end-of-life for python 2 security fixes.\n- Thunderbolt support is now available from the start menu.\n\n## KNOWN ISSUES:\n\n- If you find that after the upgrade clicking the menu button crashes the panel, then CTRL+ALT+T to open a terminal then run:\n    \n    ```\n    nohup budgie-panel --reset --replace & \n    ```\n    \n- Please read the [Ubuntu Release notes](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/EoanErmine/ReleaseNotes) which covers issues common to all Ubuntu Flavors.\n    \n\n# UPGRADING\n\n## HOW TO UPGRADE FROM 19.04 TO 19.10\n\n**IMPORTANT:** remember to double-check you have the following vital package before you upgrade:\n\n```\nsudo apt install ubuntu-budgie-desktop\n```\n\nAfter the release of 19.10, you will be offered to upgrade when you run Software & Updates.\n\nAlternatively, from a command line run:\n\n```\nupdate-manager\n```\n\n**IMPORTANT** We do not recommend running `do-release-upgrade` from a Tilix terminal since this will hang during the upgrade. If you want to use `do-release-upgrade` switch to a TTY and login before running the command.\n\nSome of the packages that were installed as part of the Ubuntu Budgie backports PPA (ppa:ubuntubudgie/backports) will be uninstalled as part of the upgrade. Use budgie-welcome to reinstall anything that is removed.\n\n## HOW TO UPGRADE FROM 18.04 OR 18.10 TO 19.10\n\nShort story - you cannot directly upgrade. You must first upgrade to 18.10 ... then 19.04 before upgrading to 19.10. Anything else is not supported nor supportable.\n\n* * *\n\nPlease refer to the community wiki for more help:\n\n[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Upgrades](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Upgrades)\n\nAlso, Ask Ubuntu has an excellent guide to help you upgrade:\n\nhttp://askubuntu.com/questions/110477/how-do-i-upgrade-to-a-newer-version-of-ubuntu\n\n# DOWNLOAD\n\nFinal release is available here: [https://ubuntubudgie.org/downloads/](https://ubuntubudgie.org/downloads/)\n\n# GETTING SUPPORT\n\nThanks to the generosity of discourse.org, our support site is the crucial site for all things Ubuntu Budgie.\n\nOne to bookmark [https://discourse.ubuntubudgie.org](https://discourse.ubuntubudgie.org)\n\nMore information can be found [here](https://ubuntubudgie.org/2018/03/08/welcome-to-discourse/).\n\n# INFRASTRUCTURE\n\nWe just wanted to thank our infrastructure sponsors who help us keep the lights on.\n\n### [DIGITAL OCEAN](https://www.digitalocean.com/)\n\nOn a mission to simplify cloud computing so developers and their teams can spend more time building software that changes the world.\n\n### [DISCOURSE](https://www.discourse.org/)\n\nDiscourse is the 100% open source discussion platform built for the next decade of the Internet.

It was showing its age – needing to be shook hard to wake up, freezing at random times and generally just being a pain to use trying to support over three or four releases at the same time all in virtual machines.\n\nWe collectively as a team decided to purchase from a Linux friendly manufacturer; we decided on the Germany based company Tuxedo since their range was very competitive. The order was placed back in November 2020 for a Tuxedo Pulse 15. We knew there would be a delay in its delivery due to the world-wide lack of the Ryzen 7 processor. It didn’t help that Brexit hit a hard-exit that caused chaos at the border and a couple of frustrating weeks waiting to clear customs. More problematic was the massive instant tariffs – so for UK based consumers its now more difficult to justify to buy electronics from anywhere other than the UK ????\n\nTuxedo arrival Well I must say I am impressed. The laptop was delivered really well packaged – it really did survive weeks on the road. Securely fitted in a customised box within a box. Padded with foam there was no chance of this thing rolling around during transport.\n\n\\[caption id=\"attachment\\_2203\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"744\"\\]![Tux1](images/tux1-744x704-1.jpg) Tux1 \\[/caption\\]\n\nThis was a really light, slim machine, with a cracking matte screen with gorgeous contrasting colours and a keyboard that was really responsive. The keyboard is backlit as well. Very stylish.\n\nUnexpected was the sound – the speaker was mounted underneath the laptop – but works perfectly – great stereo separation and sound was loud but without distortion.\n\nTuxedo OS The laptop arrived with what is called Tuxedo OS. With trepidation I switched it on knowing from members of our discourse site that this was supposedly based upon Ubuntu Budgie.\n\n\\[caption id=\"attachment\\_2204\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"744\"\\]![Tux2](images/tux2-744x780-1.jpg) Tux2 \\[/caption\\]\n\nSure enough I spotted our slideshow – to the background said \"Tuxedo\" … and the words said Ubuntu Budgie.\n\nThen the first \"what the…\"\n\n\\[caption id=\"attachment\\_2205\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"744\"\\]![Tux3](images/tux3-744x437-1.jpg) Tux3 \\[/caption\\]\n\nThe Ubuntu purple GDM3 login window – what happened with the nice Slick Greeter? Carrying on a welcome message appeared … not our budgie-welcome screen though.\n\n\\[caption id=\"attachment\\_2206\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"744\"\\]![Tux4](images/tux4-744x469-1.jpg) Tux4 \\[/caption\\]\n\nOops with the obvious typo but nice to see and \"almost ready\" message. The budgie panel has moved from top to bottom – with plank now on the left side of the screen.\n\nClicking OK presented a \"In progress\" dialog. No idea what was in progress but it seemed to stay visible for 10 minutes. The panel seem to be frozen and nothing was clickable. Then unexpectedly the laptop powered off without warning. Not a good start.\n\nBooting back up – I noticed the boot speed – from pressing the power button to the login window was 18 seconds. Later I found out that 9 seconds was the EFI splash screen – so 9 seconds from grub to logon window. Nice!\n\n\\[caption id=\"attachment\\_2207\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"744\"\\]![Tux5](images/tux5-744x604-1.jpg) Tux5\\[/caption\\]\n\nPoking around Tuxedo comes with unexpectedly linux kernel 5.6 – a Tuxedo oem kernel. The rest of the OS is based on Ubuntu 20.04.1 – so not the usual 5.4 kernel. The graphics seemed to be copied from the oibaf unstable PPA – not from the ubuntu repos.\n\nIndeed the repo list was tuxedo all over with other custom tuxedo repos.\n\n\\[caption id=\"attachment\\_2208\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"744\"\\]![Tux6 ](images/tux6-744x371-1.jpg) Tux6 \\[/caption\\]\n\nThe good… In the system tray was an icon that display a really nice custom Tuxedo Control Center\n\n\\[caption id=\"attachment\\_2209\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"744\"\\]![Tux7 ](images/tux7-744x539-1.jpg) Tux7 \\[/caption\\]\n\nNicely layed out with various sensors & support information. Bravo!\n\nThe laptop comes with a massive battery\n\n\\[caption id=\"attachment\\_2210\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"744\"\\]![Tux8](images/tux9-744x651-1.jpg) Tux8\\[/caption\\]\n\nYou can real fun with the \"Time to empty\" figure when letting the laptop go idle! In reality I’m guessing nine or more hours – more than enough to-do a full day of development.\n\nThe bad… Browsing through the menu was lots of non default Ubuntu Budgie apps – snap-store, FreeCiv, KDE Connect, Libreoffice Base, KSysGuard, LinSSID and many others.\n\nWhy the number of KDE apps I don’t know – they didn’t really integrate and really felt like bloat.\n\nBrasero disk writer was installed … this machine doesnt come with a DVD drive…\n\n\\[caption id=\"attachment\\_2211\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"744\"\\]![Tux9](images/tux8-744x583-1.jpg) Tux9\\[/caption\\]\n\nThe theme and icons are Tuxedo branded. I’m guessing its some-sort of Arc based GTK theme with a garish highlight colour. Icons are basically Moka based.\n\nThe ugly Umm – just why the KDE discover? Just so odd to see\n\n\\[caption id=\"attachment\\_2212\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"744\"\\]![Tux10 ](images/tux10-744x418-1.jpg) Tux10 \\[/caption\\]\n\nLots of software to discover via GNOME Software … and duplicated by snap-store as well!\n\nConclusions The hardware is perfect. I can only congratulate Tuxedo for producing a really nice machine – powerful, well spec’d at a great price.\n\nTuxedo OS is a missed opportunity – weird defaults such as a purple GDM3, snap-store plus non integrated KDE based apps with several I’m wondering why they were included. The vendor seems to miss the elegance motif and thrown in a full grab-bag.\n\nRunning an update I was hoping the ancient kernel would be at least updated to the supported 5.8 HWE kernel. Unfortunately not.\n\nI would acknowledge I am biased – at the end-of-the-day I didn’t buy this for the operating system – I bought it for the hardware and I warmly recommend it.\n\nNeedless to say – after 30 minutes I purged Tuxedo OS and installed both 20.04.2 Ubuntu Budgie & 21.04. Boot speed for 21.04 is 6 seconds from Grub to login window. Both variants of our distro work perfectly demonstrating installing Linux on a friendly Linux vendor based machine really makes sense.\n\nDavid (project lead)","src/content/blog/2021/02/tuxedo-pulse-15-new-development-machine.md",[2382,2383,2384,2385,2386,2387,2388,2389,2390,2391],"images/tux1-744x704-1.jpg","images/tux2-744x780-1.jpg","images/tux3-744x437-1.jpg","images/tux4-744x469-1.jpg","images/tux5-744x604-1.jpg","images/tux6-744x371-1.jpg","images/tux7-744x539-1.jpg","images/tux9-744x651-1.jpg","images/tux8-744x583-1.jpg","images/tux10-744x418-1.jpg","e584280e079311d3",{"html":2394,"metadata":2395},"\u003Cp>Introduction Thanks to all of our generous donors the Ubuntu Budgie team has purchased a development laptop for me to continue supporting and developing our distro.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Up until now, I have been using my own personal laptop since the first 16.04 budgie-remix days.

Team member Sam Lane has been actively creating this and we as a team hope you enjoy his efforts and ideas.\n\nIn these release notes the areas covered are:\n\n- Budgie ARM Configuration Tool\n- Raspberry Pi Remote Options\n- FindMyPi\n- Known Issues\n- Where to download Ubuntu Budgie\n\n## Summary\n\nUbuntu Budgie is the sum of many hundreds of developers working together.\n\n21.04 is a large release in itself and we'll describe the desktop release in separate release notes.\n\nHere we describe what we have done for Ubuntu Budgie on a Raspberry Pi.\n\nWe recommend this image for a **Raspberry Pi 4 & 400 with 4/8Gb Ram 32Gb SD Card**. Whilst the image can be installed on older variants we do not recommend it. Best use other more suited images for these lower powered Pi's.

Please check again in the next week or so**\n\nUbuntu Budgie 21.04 is a normal release that will be supported for 9 months until Jan 2022. Long Term Releases such as 20.04.2 provide assured stability over a longer term (3 yrs) than a standard 9 month release. Critical and stability fixes will be released for all the supported Ubuntu Budgie components; these will be undertaken by ourselves, Canonical and the wider Ubuntu community.\n\nIn these release notes the areas covered are:\n\n- New features and enhancements\n- Upgrading from 20.04.2/20.10 Ubuntu Budgie\n- Known Issues when upgrading\n- Where to download Ubuntu Budgie\n\n\\[caption id=\"attachment\\_2327\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"744\"\\]![Desktop 21.04](images/desktop2104-744x418-1.jpg) Desktop 21.04\\[/caption\\]\n\n## Summary\n\nUbuntu Budgie is the sum of many hundreds of developers working together. For 21.04 your Ubuntu Budgie team have unfortunately done a bad thing ... we have rocked our largest release ever...\n\nFor 21.04 we now have our very first Raspberry Pi 4 image - this is an area lots of members from the UB community have talked about over the years - and its thanks to new team member Sam Lane that we have made this a reality. Do checkout our release notes specifically for the [Raspberry Pi 4](https://ubuntubudgie.org/2021/03/release-notes-ubuntu-budgie-21-04-on-a-raspberry-pi-4/)\n\n![file](images/post-2217-608eb23a1c990.png)\n\nBudgie Desktop has now been uplifted to the very latest v10.5.2. We are pleased as a team to have contributed to this release - the results from the whole budgie developer community really shows in 21.04\n\nWe now include another Mac like makeover using the fabulous WhiteSur theme and icons through a click of a button. We have also backported this to 20.04 LTS and 21.04.\n\nAlso, we also have show-cased two new optional applets from the budgie developer community. Again we have backported these and made available to 20.04 LTS and 21.04.\n\nOur desktop has been refreshed - we now sport a darker theme as a default with a brand new makeup for our Pocillo icons.\n\nWindows Shuffler now includes a key new capability called Layouts. Its now just a click of a button to move/launch/run windows and apps across multiple monitors in whatever desktop layout you want.\n\nTaken together, all the smaller changes plus the larger enhancements shapes our distro to be fully flexible and customisable to your workflow; with sane defaults to provide a first rate experience from the get-go.\n\n## Applets and mini-apps\n\n1. Window Shuffler - Window Rules: Add ability to set the position and size together with the monitor location to open an application on\n2. Window Shuffler - Layouts: Add the ability to launch and group together multiple applications\n\n[![](images/post-2217-608eb23a37456.)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBtvrcf-IfU)\n\n4. Applications Menu:\n    \n    - Cosmetic - labels on budgie-desktop-settings are left aligned.\n    - from upstream Terminal apps are no-longer shown in the menu such as xterm\n5. QuickChar installation is now easier on other on Debian based distro's - should not now need to patch your install locations\n    \n6. A new independent applet called budgie-clipboard-applet is now available - backported to 20.04 and 20.10 - look out for it via Menu - Budgie Extras\n    \n\n![file](images/post-2217-608eb23bd923b.png)\n\n7. A new independent applet called budgie-analogue-applet ([https://github.com/samlane-ma/budgie-analog-clock](https://github.com/samlane-ma/budgie-analog-clock)) is now available and has been backported to 20.04 and 20.10 as well.\n\n![file](images/post-2217-608eb23d379ed.png)\n\n8. Bug fix for the applications menu so that rollover menus settings is remembered on logon.\n9. The number of cities that our weather applet can now search has increased from 22.6k to 185k\n10. Change to budgie-pixel-saver-applet. It now handles blacklisting of apps to stop it trying to add window decorations where a window didn't have one in the first place. e.g. Firefox, Telegram and Ulauncher. This has been backported to 20.04 & 20.10 as well.\n\n## Budgie Desktop\n\n**v10.5.2 abridged upstream Solus release note summary here**\n\nBudgie 10.5.2 introduces new goodies to make your Budgie experience even better!\n\nBudgie Menu has received various refinements for this release:\n\n- Budgie Menu introduces additional checks for an application's DesktopAppInfo, ensuring that we consistently skip apps and exclude them from calculations when they have Hidden or NoDisplay set, as well as if the NotShowIn contains Budgie.\n- Budgie Menu will no longer show empty categories, a common occurrence when installing applications via WINE.\n- Budgie Menu will now alphabetically sort category names, which is useful when you have custom user desktop directories for applications. They are no longer forced to be below default system-wide desktop directories such as Internet / Networking, Office, Sound & Video, etc.\n- Applications which utilize pkexec in their desktop info will now spawn an asynchronous process, with pkexec being the command and passing the rest of the command line content as arguments.\n\n![file](images/post-2217-608eb23ee3817.png)\n\nThe Icon Tasklist applet has seen new features and behaviour refinements in Budgie 10.5.2.\n\n- There are now two new options available, disabled by default, to launch a new instance of an application via the respective button for the application: middle click and double click. This expands on our existing option to create a new instance of an application by clicking the + button in the popover of each Icon Button.\n- The behavior of the Icon Tasklist has been refined in Budgie 10.5.2. We have consolidated duplicate logic in other less used classes into our dedicated application state tracking class, which is used by the Icon Tasklist and IconPopover to provide a list of running applications, their AppInfo, any group they belong to, and more. This consolidation has meant more consistent “skip pager” checks, as well as more consistent rejection of various types of windows, such as docks, apps with splashscreens and utilities e.g. controls for an emulator.\n- Thanks to this more consistent window type rejection, we are able to more closely discern between what is budgie-panel versus what is budgie-desktop-settings, which is part of the panel but is otherwise a NORMAL type application. This enabled us to resolve an issue where the pin and new instance buttons were being unintentionally shown, as well as an issue where you could not close Budgie Desktop Settings via the IconPopover controls (right click popover for each Icon Button in the tasklist).\n- After close discussions with members of the community on our forums on the expected behaviour of the Icon Tasklist, time was spent refining the behaviour of Icon Tasklist and individual Icon Buttons to be more consistent. Here are some examples: a. When the “Show All Windows on Click” option is enabled, we will now more consistently show or minimize all windows on click if one of them is currently active. b. If only one instance of an application is open and it is on another workspace (in this case the “Restrict to Workspace” option is not enabled), we switch to that workspace and unminimize the window (since the chances are you probably want to see the application in the first place).\n- We are always listening to feedback on how to improve the behaviour of Icon Tasklist while ensuring it remains simple and approachable to use. If you have an idea on how to improve it further, feel free to file an issue on Budgie's issue tracker.\n\n![file](images/post-2217-608eb240f0565.png)\n\nThe Sound applet has seen a redesign and now features a dedicated button for mute toggling, as well as leveraging iconography for the System Settings button rather than text.\n\n![file](images/post-2217-608eb2423f76f.png)\n\nDating back to the days of Budgie 7 in 2014, Budgie had been using an na-tray implementation also seen in desktop environments such as Cinnamon for the creation and management of system tray icons. Thanks to the incredible work by Solus contributor Campbell Jones, the System Tray has been completely rewritten from scratch, supporting tray icons leveraging the XEmbed Protocol. This new implementation resolves numerous issues such as:\n\n- Background icons not refreshing, resulting in instances where it may appear that multiple icons are overlapping.\n- Tray icons not consistently hiding when a panel hides (during “Intelligent” mode).\n- Tray icons blinking when panel transparency is set to “Dynamic”\n- Tray icons getting hidden when switching icon themes.\n\nAdditionally, a configuration option has been added for the System Tray that enables the setting of spacing between individual icons, making it perfect for those that want both their applets and tray icons to be equidistant!\n\n![file](images/post-2217-608eb24418a48.png)\n\nBudgie Desktop View has been updated to provide a clearer differentiation between removing a Panel and removing an applet from a Panel. A dedicated button for removing a panel has been added below the Panel's applet list, with a description that makes its purpose clearer. This button will not appear when you only have one panel in your Budgie setup. Building on this, we have removed the option to disable the panel removal confirmation dialog. From user reports, the consensus was that this option was too easy to enable, would result in accidental permanent removal of panels more frequently than desired, and lacked a clear user-friendly method to re-enable the prompt.\n\n![file](images/post-2217-608eb245bb46a.png)\n\nFor those which use Budgie in another language than English, the menu items presented when adding a new Autostart application or command via the Autostart section are now translatable. For any language which has the terms translated, those will be used instead.\n\nBudgie 10.5.2 is the first release of Budgie to feature a new budgie specific desktop icons implementation. Whilst not the default in Ubuntu Budgie, it is available to be installed called budgie-desktop-view.\n\n![file](images/post-2217-608eb24881461.png)\n\nThis budgie specific implementation has been to introduce via a new, separate project that could be iterated on independently from Budgie Desktop itself. This project needed to be rigorously focused and developed with an understanding of the scope and intent of the project, not trying to be a file manager but rather a method of quickly accessing the content and applications you consider most important.\n\nBudgie has always been about striking a balance in customization and that extends to the support we provide downstreams like Ubuntu Budgie as well. That is why we worked hard on introducing a new vendor-oriented mechanism to enable downstreams to choose a desktop icons implementation that fits them and their users best. Alongside our own “native” Budgie Desktop View implementation, we are providing official support in the Budgie Desktop Settings application for the configuration of DesktopFolder and Nemo.\n\nRaven Thanks to Solus contributor Evan Maddock, Budgie 10.5.2 introduces a new option to choose which side of the screen Raven should be. Prior to Budgie 10.5.2, Raven would always appear on the left side when the main panel and trigger were on the left, and appear on the right when the main panel was anywhere else.\n\nUsers will be able to choose between this behaviour, called “Automatic”, as well as left and right sides!\n\n![file](images/post-2217-608eb24b45001.png)\n\nTranslations Thanks to our incredible community members that have stepped up to translate Budgie, Budgie is now more accessible than ever. Budgie 10.5.2 introduces support for three new languages: Afrikaans, Albanian, and Hindi. Budgie now has 40 languages which have 90% or more coverage and we have seen dedicated translators step up for a wide range of languages, many of which are now completely translated.\n\nWe are still working hard to get Budgie translated 100% into many languages. If you are interested in helping translate Budgie into your language, feel free to reach out!\n\nHere are some other aspects of Budgie that received refinements:\n\n- Animation disabling: Background transitions and workspace switching are no longer always enabled but now honor the option to disable animations in Budgie Desktop Settings\n- Budgie's Application Switcher a. Typically referred to as the Alt+Tab switcher, this switcher now supports the Ctrl modifier, adding support for more custom keyboard layouts and mappings. b. We now support an option to show all windows from all workspaces in the switcher, enabling you to switch between applications and workspaces simultaneously. c. Budgie Run Dialog can now check keywords, improving search and aligning its behaviour closer to that of Budgie Menu.\n- Caffeine Applet: When Caffeine Mode is enabled, the timer will now update the spin button value based on how many minutes are remaining.\n    - Forward-specific keyboard layout switching can now be done with Alt+Shift.\n    - Transparency is now supported in background images, falling back to the fixed color or gradient behind it.\n    - We now provide an option via GSettings to configure the desired screenshot commands, so downstreams can use alternatives to gnome-screenshot.\n\nIn addition to all the quality of life improvements and features we have added, Budgie 10.5.2 introduces many bug fixes including for some issues dating back years to the early days of Budgie 10.\n\n- Fix Workspace Applet allowing more than max supported workspace count. We will now return a -1 on our WM AppendNewWorkspace if we are rejecting more additions of workspaces, which informs our WorkspaceApplet to not show the + button (even if set to always show) and reject drag actions onto new workspaces.\n- Added missing LEFT and RIGHT panel layouts in the manager, which prevented downstreams and users from using panel.ini files with left or right panels.\n- During panel initialization, we will now appropriately set dock-mode if needed, which fixes an issue where the class would only be applied if the dock mode setting actually changed.\n- Fix a crash when removing an applet with missing information.\n- The Tasklist applet will no longer cause the rest of the panel contents to be thrown into the aether when you have many windows open. You will be able to scroll up / down to get all the windows and we will be working on dedicated buttons in the tasklist applet in Budgie 10.5.3. This resolves two bugs, one from 2014 and another from 2017.\n- Regions which do not have any panel widgets / applets will no longer be shown, allowing applets to take up more space and eliminates weird spacing related issues.\n- When changing away from dock mode on a panel, we will now correctly remove the dock-mode CSS class.\n- Chromium-based browser notifications no longer display with broken icon images. This was due to the fact that these browsers would prefix the icon with file:/// and Chromium-based browsers would not pass the correct path. We will now default to the fallback mail-unread-symbolic icon for these applications.\n- Notifications and Notification Groups can no longer be selected, which would result in a visual change with no obvious or easy way to deselect them. There are no functional changes, as there are no actions which make use of the selection of Notifications or Notification Groups.\n- Notifications are no longer appended to Notification Groups, resulting in older Notifications being higher in a Notification Group's list than newer ones.\n- The Sound widget will no longer allow raising the volume above 100% when the option is off.\n- The MPRIS player will correct the album art URLs provided by Spotify, which would otherwise be misreported by Spotify, resulting in images which could not be found.\n- Budgie Popovers will now properly handle window scale factors.\n- Crash fixes related to the usage of Wnck have been resolved.\n- Fix some custom keyboard shortcuts and media keys not correctly applying after boot or reboot.\n- Night Light will now appropriately start or end if an application has the fullscreen state amongst its many states, and not just being fullscreen. This is useful if you have an application which is fullscreen and above or below other windows, is sticky (maintains position regardless of workspace), shaded, etc.\n\nFor this release, Ubuntu Budgei also has a fix added for non-english keyboard layouts such as Japanese/Chinese/Korean etc. We have added a bug-fix into budgie-desktop so that Ibus suggestions are displayed.\n\n## Themes\n\n1. The Vimix theme make-over in budgie-themes & layouts was broken - this is now fixed and backported to 20.04 & 20.10\n2. The latest QogirBudgie theme has been updated from upstream with a whole host of fixes.\n3. Pocillo - enhancements to the look and feel: a. sidebar now is shaded - this is now consistent with the dark variant.  \n    b. similarly all button controls are now shaded c. Nemo toolbar is also shaded. d. Budgie Desktop Settings has been tweaked to resolve right-truncated controls.  \n    e. Shadows has been reduced and f. padding overall has been reduced to give a more compact feeling. g. Thanks to @UltraBurstXD scrollbars have been restyled with a better colour suited to the different pocillo variants. In addition scrollbars default to a thin style which make then more elegant in our opinion.\n4. Our Pocillo icon theme now inherits from a combination of Tela-Icons and Qogir Panel/symbolic icons\n5. Our default theme is now \"Pocillo-dark\"\n6. Moka and Faba icons have now been dropped from the default install.\n7. The Mojave gtk theme has been refreshed upstream and is now in budgie welcome for 20.10 and 21.04 users.\n8. The McMojave circle icon theme has been refreshed upstream and is now in budgie welcome for 20.04/20.10 & 21.04 users\n9. Now available in v0.14.0 budgie-welcome is the WhiteSur make-over which includes the whitesur gtk theme/whitesur icons and roboto fonts. budgie welcome and this makeover is also available for 20.04 and 20.10\n\n![file](images/post-2217-608eb24e65287.png)\n\n## Budgie Welcome\n\n1. Themes and Layouts now show a tab-look interface - this should aid discovery of layouts since it appears people couldn't instantly visualise that option\n\n![file](images/post-2217-608eb2509d88e.png)\n\n2. Budgie Welcome now starts significantly faster on first start\n3. Budgie Welcome uses the latest bootstrap v4 which includes faster display and navigation usage\n4. Analogue Clock Applet added to Menu - Budgie Extras\n5. Latest translations from our [transifex team](https://www.transifex.com/ubuntu-budgie/budgie-welcome)\n6. Our Getting Started guide now covers keyboard shortcuts to move windows to other monitors\n\n![file](images/post-2217-608eb25309e2d.png)\n\n4. Brave can now be installed from Getting Started - Browser Ballot\n\n![file](images/post-2217-608eb25516a97.png)\n\n5. Browser Ballot is now aware which architecture Welcome is running on - so only browsers applicable to Pi (for example) is displayed\n6. Gutenprint is a Recommended application\n7. Pocillo makeover defaults to dark-theme for 21.04 to correspond to the new default - the standard theme is used for 20.04 and 20.10\n\n## Additional\n\n1. Often requested, htop has now been added as a default install --> this may be removed again if we can't hide from the menu\n\n![file](images/post-2217-608eb2571d8f5.png)\n\n2. We have run a poll with the community and the community have clearly spoken: thunderbird is now the default email client. Geary has been dropped from the ISO.\n3. The backup tool deja-dup has become a great tool for backups and restores and we are more than happy to include this on our ISO out of the box.\n\n![file](images/post-2217-608eb2591ff47.png)\n\n4. Out of the box we now include thousands of printer drivers including support for Epson and Canon printers via printer-driver-gutenprint\n\n![file](images/post-2217-608eb25ac58ad.png)\n\n5. We now include sane-airscan which supports thousands of modern network scanners (and a few USB based as well). Use simple-scan to connect to your scanner.\n6. Budgie Arm & Pi - this tiny app will appear in your menu which ties our Raspberry Pi efforts with the main distro - more information here [https://ubuntubudgie.org/2021/03/release-notes-ubuntu-budgie-21-04-on-a-raspberry-pi-4/](https://ubuntubudgie.org/2021/03/release-notes-ubuntu-budgie-21-04-on-a-raspberry-pi-4/)\n\n## Areas to look out for\n\n1. We now include gnome-remote-desktop instead of vino - Use Settings - Sharing to enable. Lookout for the ability to share Media folders, Remote Login (SSH) as well as Screen-sharing (VNC)\n2. Slick Greeter now has the ability to configure the format of the clock - use Login Window to-do this.\n3. Whilst Moka icons is no longer part of our defaults, we continue to look after the package on behalf of Debian and Ubuntu. Lots of proposed pull-requests have been included in our soft-fork to continue making Moka a first class icon set for all users.\n4. Groovy backports have been copied to hirsute\n5. Look out for our 21.04 wallpapers - enjoy!\n\n![file](images/post-2217-608eb25d81205.png)\n\n6. In Settings - there is now a \"Power Mode\" section. The performance profile will only be available on systems which provide this functionality.\n\n![file](images/post-2217-608eb25f86429.png)\n\n7. Some GNOME \"40\" applications are now in the repository. If they have been compiled with GTK-4 they will be Adwaita themed. This is to be expected since the vast majority of GTK themes only support GTK-3 and GTK-2 at this point in time. Please let us know which apps are Adwaita themed so we can monitor in future how these apps behave in newer themes made available as part of the 21.10 & 22.04 development cycles.\n\n## KEY FEATURES AVAILABLE TO UB FROM UBUNTU\n\n- Linux kernel v5.11\n- GNOME 40 applications\n- Latest version of LibreOffice 7.1\n\nWhat does all that mean - most cutting edge yet stable software that brings great benefits for brand new hardware compatibility - including support for the very latest games.\n\n## UB MAINTAINED PACKAGES\n\nApart from the above (!) UB maintains many Debian packages. New versions available in 21.04 include:\n\n- Slick Greeter\n- Login Window Preferences\n- DesktopFolder\n- Arc Theme\n\n## KNOWN ISSUES\n\n- If you find that after the upgrade clicking the menu button crashes the panel, then CTRL+ALT+T to open a terminal then run:\n    \n    ```\n    nohup budgie-panel --reset --replace &\n    ```\n    \n- Launching terminal based apps from the menu does not work. Workaround is to fool GLib to assume that a supported terminal (tilix isnt supported) is installed `sudo ln -s /usr/bin/tilix /usr/bin/nxterm`.

This expands on our existing option to create a new instance of an application by clicking the + button in the popover of each Icon Button.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>The behavior of the Icon Tasklist has been refined in Budgie 10.5.2. We have consolidated duplicate logic in other less used classes into our dedicated application state tracking class, which is used by the Icon Tasklist and IconPopover to provide a list of running applications, their AppInfo, any group they belong to, and more. This consolidation has meant more consistent “skip pager” checks, as well as more consistent rejection of various types of windows, such as docks, apps with splashscreens and utilities e.g. controls for an emulator.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Thanks to this more consistent window type rejection, we are able to more closely discern between what is budgie-panel versus what is budgie-desktop-settings, which is part of the panel but is otherwise a NORMAL type application. This enabled us to resolve an issue where the pin and new instance buttons were being unintentionally shown, as well as an issue where you could not close Budgie Desktop Settings via the IconPopover controls (right click popover for each Icon Button in the tasklist).\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>After close discussions with members of the community on our forums on the expected behaviour of the Icon Tasklist, time was spent refining the behaviour of Icon Tasklist and individual Icon Buttons to be more consistent. Here are some examples: a. When the “Show All Windows on Click” option is enabled, we will now more consistently show or minimize all windows on click if one of them is currently active. b. If only one instance of an application is open and it is on another workspace (in this case the “Restrict to Workspace” option is not enabled), we switch to that workspace and unminimize the window (since the chances are you probably want to see the application in the first place).\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>We are always listening to feedback on how to improve the behaviour of Icon Tasklist while ensuring it remains simple and approachable to use. If you have an idea on how to improve it further, feel free to file an issue on Budgie’s issue tracker.\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ul>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg __ASTRO_IMAGE_=\"{&#x22;src&#x22;:&#x22;images/post-2217-608eb240f0565.png&#x22;,&#x22;alt&#x22;:&#x22;file&#x22;,&#x22;index&#x22;:0}\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The Sound applet has seen a redesign and now features a dedicated button for mute toggling, as well as leveraging iconography for the System Settings button rather than text.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg __ASTRO_IMAGE_=\"{&#x22;src&#x22;:&#x22;images/post-2217-608eb2423f76f.png&#x22;,&#x22;alt&#x22;:&#x22;file&#x22;,&#x22;index&#x22;:0}\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Dating back to the days of Budgie 7 in 2014, Budgie had been using an na-tray implementation also seen in desktop environments such as Cinnamon for the creation and management of system tray icons. Thanks to the incredible work by Solus contributor Campbell Jones, the System Tray has been completely rewritten from scratch, supporting tray icons leveraging the XEmbed Protocol. This new implementation resolves numerous issues such as:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>Background icons not refreshing, resulting in instances where it may appear that multiple icons are overlapping.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Tray icons not consistently hiding when a panel hides (during “Intelligent” mode).\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Tray icons blinking when panel transparency is set to “Dynamic”\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Tray icons getting hidden when switching icon themes.\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ul>\n\u003Cp>Additionally, a configuration option has been added for the System Tray that enables the setting of spacing between individual icons, making it perfect for those that want both their applets and tray icons to be equidistant!\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg __ASTRO_IMAGE_=\"{&#x22;src&#x22;:&#x22;images/post-2217-608eb24418a48.png&#x22;,&#x22;alt&#x22;:&#x22;file&#x22;,&#x22;index&#x22;:0}\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Budgie Desktop View has been updated to provide a clearer differentiation between removing a Panel and removing an applet from a Panel. A dedicated button for removing a panel has been added below the Panel’s applet list, with a description that makes its purpose clearer. This button will not appear when you only have one panel in your Budgie setup. Building on this, we have removed the option to disable the panel removal confirmation dialog. From user reports, the consensus was that this option was too easy to enable, would result in accidental permanent removal of panels more frequently than desired, and lacked a clear user-friendly method to re-enable the prompt.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg __ASTRO_IMAGE_=\"{&#x22;src&#x22;:&#x22;images/post-2217-608eb245bb46a.png&#x22;,&#x22;alt&#x22;:&#x22;file&#x22;,&#x22;index&#x22;:0}\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>For those which use Budgie in another language than English, the menu items presented when adding a new Autostart application or command via the Autostart section are now translatable. For any language which has the terms translated, those will be used instead.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Budgie 10.5.2 is the first release of Budgie to feature a new budgie specific desktop icons implementation. Whilst not the default in Ubuntu Budgie, it is available to be installed called budgie-desktop-view.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg __ASTRO_IMAGE_=\"{&#x22;src&#x22;:&#x22;images/post-2217-608eb24881461.png&#x22;,&#x22;alt&#x22;:&#x22;file&#x22;,&#x22;index&#x22;:0}\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>This budgie specific implementation has been to introduce via a new, separate project that could be iterated on independently from Budgie Desktop itself. This project needed to be rigorously focused and developed with an understanding of the scope and intent of the project, not trying to be a file manager but rather a method of quickly accessing the content and applications you consider most important.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Budgie has always been about striking a balance in customization and that extends to the support we provide downstreams like Ubuntu Budgie as well. That is why we worked hard on introducing a new vendor-oriented mechanism to enable downstreams to choose a desktop icons implementation that fits them and their users best. Alongside our own “native” Budgie Desktop View implementation, we are providing official support in the Budgie Desktop Settings application for the configuration of DesktopFolder and Nemo.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Raven Thanks to Solus contributor Evan Maddock, Budgie 10.5.2 introduces a new option to choose which side of the screen Raven should be. Prior to Budgie 10.5.2, Raven would always appear on the left side when the main panel and trigger were on the left, and appear on the right when the main panel was anywhere else.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Users will be able to choose between this behaviour, called “Automatic”, as well as left and right sides!\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg __ASTRO_IMAGE_=\"{&#x22;src&#x22;:&#x22;images/post-2217-608eb24b45001.png&#x22;,&#x22;alt&#x22;:&#x22;file&#x22;,&#x22;index&#x22;:0}\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Translations Thanks to our incredible community members that have stepped up to translate Budgie, Budgie is now more accessible than ever. Budgie 10.5.2 introduces support for three new languages: Afrikaans, Albanian, and Hindi. Budgie now has 40 languages which have 90% or more coverage and we have seen dedicated translators step up for a wide range of languages, many of which are now completely translated.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>We are still working hard to get Budgie translated 100% into many languages. If you are interested in helping translate Budgie into your language, feel free to reach out!\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Here are some other aspects of Budgie that received refinements:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>Animation disabling: Background transitions and workspace switching are no longer always enabled but now honor the option to disable animations in Budgie Desktop Settings\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Budgie’s Application Switcher a. Typically referred to as the Alt+Tab switcher, this switcher now supports the Ctrl modifier, adding support for more custom keyboard layouts and mappings. b. We now support an option to show all windows from all workspaces in the switcher, enabling you to switch between applications and workspaces simultaneously. c. Budgie Run Dialog can now check keywords, improving search and aligning its behaviour closer to that of Budgie Menu.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Caffeine Applet: When Caffeine Mode is enabled, the timer will now update the spin button value based on how many minutes are remaining.\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>Forward-specific keyboard layout switching can now be done with Alt+Shift.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Transparency is now supported in background images, falling back to the fixed color or gradient behind it.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>We now provide an option via GSettings to configure the desired screenshot commands, so downstreams can use alternatives to gnome-screenshot.\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ul>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ul>\n\u003Cp>In addition to all the quality of life improvements and features we have added, Budgie 10.5.2 introduces many bug fixes including for some issues dating back years to the early days of Budgie 10.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>Fix Workspace Applet allowing more than max supported workspace count. We will now return a -1 on our WM AppendNewWorkspace if we are rejecting more additions of workspaces, which informs our WorkspaceApplet to not show the + button (even if set to always show) and reject drag actions onto new workspaces.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Added missing LEFT and RIGHT panel layouts in the manager, which prevented downstreams and users from using panel.ini files with left or right panels.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>During panel initialization, we will now appropriately set dock-mode if needed, which fixes an issue where the class would only be applied if the dock mode setting actually changed.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Fix a crash when removing an applet with missing information.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>The Tasklist applet will no longer cause the rest of the panel contents to be thrown into the aether when you have many windows open. You will be able to scroll up / down to get all the windows and we will be working on dedicated buttons in the tasklist applet in Budgie 10.5.3. This resolves two bugs, one from 2014 and another from 2017.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Regions which do not have any panel widgets / applets will no longer be shown, allowing applets to take up more space and eliminates weird spacing related issues.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>When changing away from dock mode on a panel, we will now correctly remove the dock-mode CSS class.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Chromium-based browser notifications no longer display with broken icon images. This was due to the fact that these browsers would prefix the icon with file:/// and Chromium-based browsers would not pass the correct path. We will now default to the fallback mail-unread-symbolic icon for these applications.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Notifications and Notification Groups can no longer be selected, which would result in a visual change with no obvious or easy way to deselect them. There are no functional changes, as there are no actions which make use of the selection of Notifications or Notification Groups.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Notifications are no longer appended to Notification Groups, resulting in older Notifications being higher in a Notification Group’s list than newer ones.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>The Sound widget will no longer allow raising the volume above 100% when the option is off.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>The MPRIS player will correct the album art URLs provided by Spotify, which would otherwise be misreported by Spotify, resulting in images which could not be found.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Budgie Popovers will now properly handle window scale factors.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Crash fixes related to the usage of Wnck have been resolved.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Fix some custom keyboard shortcuts and media keys not correctly applying after boot or reboot.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Night Light will now appropriately start or end if an application has the fullscreen state amongst its many states, and not just being fullscreen. This is useful if you have an application which is fullscreen and above or below other windows, is sticky (maintains position regardless of workspace), shaded, etc.\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ul>\n\u003Cp>For this release, Ubuntu Budgei also has a fix added for non-english keyboard layouts such as Japanese/Chinese/Korean etc. We have added a bug-fix into budgie-desktop so that Ibus suggestions are displayed.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"themes\">Themes\u003C/h2>\n\u003Col>\n\u003Cli>The Vimix theme make-over in budgie-themes &#x26; layouts was broken - this is now fixed and backported to 20.04 &#x26; 20.10\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>The latest QogirBudgie theme has been updated from upstream with a whole host of fixes.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Pocillo - enhancements to the look and feel: a. sidebar now is shaded - this is now consistent with the dark variant.\u003Cbr>\nb. similarly all button controls are now shaded c.

I always had a look at those but never considered them powerful enough for what I do. However, now that the raspberry PI 4B 8GB is out, and Ubuntu Budgie released Alpha1 of Ubuntu Budgie 21.10, I thought it was time to finally jump in and check it out.\n\n## Project idea and overview\n\nI really like a nice and tidy setup, with good cable management. Looking around in my geek lair, I realized I had an old 23\" monitor, FullHD, that I no longer had a use for. And that monitor came with VESA holes. And that’s when I had an idea. Why not make a DIY All-In-One desktop, based on the raspberry PI 4B and Ubuntu Budgie? Wow, that sounded fun.\n\nThis is what I am going to do: a DIY AIO computer with Raspberry PI 4B\\_8GB and of course, I am going to use Ubuntu Budgie with it. If you like the idea, stay with me, I am going to show you what to do to get this project completed in no time, and with little cost.\n\n## Shopping list\n\nFirst of all, the fun part. It took me some time to get all parts together:\n\n- Raspberry PI 4B 8GB\n- 128GB class10 microSD\n- Original power supply, USB-C, 3A, black\n- microHDMI to HDMI 50cm cable\n- Aluminum case with VESA mount\n- VESA adapter from 7.5cm to 10cm\n- Extra large heat sink with fan\n- FullHD webcam\n- Bluetooth small keyboard and mouse\n- 10 meters of spiral wrapping band\n- Black zip ties and velcro\n\n## Hardware setup\n\nHardware setup is nice and easy, compared to assembling a full tower PC.

Is this going to be any useful? Let’s find out!\n\n## Ubuntu Budgie install and tweak\n\nFirst of all, we need to download Ubuntu Budgie ARM 21.10 from this location:  \n[https://sourceforge.net/projects/budgie-remix/files/budgie-raspi-21.10/](https://sourceforge.net/projects/budgie-remix/files/budgie-raspi-21.10/)\n\n**NOTE:** If you prefer a stable relase, you can download Ubuntu Budgie ARM 21.04 from this location:  \n[https://sourceforge.net/projects/budgie-remix/files/budgie-raspi/](https://sourceforge.net/projects/budgie-remix/files/budgie-raspi/)\n\nThen, extract and burn the image to microSD card, using “Disks” utility in Ubuntu Budgie:\n\n1. Insert microSD\n2. Open “Disks” utility\n3. Select microSD card\n4. On top 3 dot menu, select “Restore Disk Image”\n5. Browse to Ubuntu Budgie ARM 21.10 image, select and confirm\n\n\u003Cfigure>\n\n![Mg Ubuntubudgie Arm 07 744x383 1](images/mg-ubuntubudgie-arm-07-744x383-1.jpg)\n\n\u003Cfigcaption>\n\nBurning image to microSD  \n\n\u003C/figcaption>\n\n\u003C/figure>\n\n## First Boot, and system optimizations with Budgie ARM TweakTool\n\nFirst boot might take a while and that is to be expected. On login, Budgie ARM TweakTool opens up automatically. well, how to say no? Time for some tweaks! Let’s open Budgie ARM TweakTool, and see what we can do with it: Layout options, Overclock, Remote, and Display. Sweet! Our Sam and David really did a great job with this.\n\n### Budgie ARM TweakTool – CPU Overclock\n\nFirst of all, we are going to overclock the CPU. I got that massive heatsink, fan, and aluminum case for that reason. From the Budgie ARM TweakTool, select “Overclock” Tab, and select 2.0Ghz. Apply by clicking on “Set Clock Speed”.\n\n\u003Cfigure>\n\n![Mg Ubuntubudgie Arm 05 744x419 1](images/mg-ubuntubudgie-arm-05-744x419-1.jpg)\n\n\u003Cfigcaption>\n\nBudgie ARM TweakTool – Overclock  \n\n\u003C/figcaption>\n\n\u003C/figure>\n\n### Budgie ARM TweakTool – GPU Memory\n\nWhat else can we do? Assign more RAM to the GPU. That sounds useful. Select “Display” Tab – GPU Memory, and select 512MB memory. Apply by clicking on “Update Memory”.\n\n\u003Cfigure>\n\n![Mg Ubuntubudgie Arm 06 744x419 1](images/mg-ubuntubudgie-arm-06-744x419-1.jpg)\n\n\u003Cfigcaption>\n\nBudgie ARM TweakTool – Display  \n\n\u003C/figcaption>\n\n\u003C/figure>\n\n## Other optimizations: ramdisks and preload\n\nNext up, we are going to speed up our system and extend our microSD card’s life by using our 8GB of ram as much as possible. This includes moving some parts of our filesystem in ramdisks, and using Preload to speed up our system a bit.\n\n### RAMDISKS\n\nFirst we are going to move our temporary folders and logs folder to ramdisk. Ramdisks are basically filesystems created in ram. They won’t wear down our microSD, and they are super fast.\n\nThe catch is, everything there is lost on reboot. In our case, we don’t really care. /tmp and /var/tmp are temporary folders and they are not really meant to store anything important anyway.\n\n/var/log is actually one of the places where our operative system writes all the time, and I want to avoid that. Typically I don’t want to move my /var/log to ramdisk on servers. But honestly, I don’t really care to check my logs after reboot on this desktop machine. There are other solutions that use rsync to write the logs back to microSD, but I find it is not really needed in my case. And If I have to troubleshoot some ongoing issue, I can always comment the line in fstab and go back to normal for a few days.\n\nLet’s edit our fstab first and add the lines below.\n\n```\nnano /etc/fstab\n```\n\nAdd the 3 lines at the end\n\n```\ntmpfs /tmp tmpfs defaults,noatime,nosuid,size=500m 0 0\ntmpfs /var/tmp tmpfs defaults,noatime,nosuid,size=500m 0 0\ntmpfs /var/log tmpfs defaults,noatime,nosuid,mode=0755,size=500m 0 0\n```\n\n**NOTE:** size=500m means each ramdisk is limited to a maximum of 500MB of ram used. It is not going to use 500MB of ram on system start though, so higher values are safer in my opinion. We have plenty of ram on this Raspberry PI 4B 8GB and Ubuntu Budgie is quite lightweight.\n\n### Preload\n\nNext, I really want to make good use of all that ram to speed up the system a bit. Preload will learn libraries and applications I use the most, and load those in RAM when we boot our systems. Sure, there is a tradeoff, reboots will be slower. But using the system will be a bit faster. Since I don’t really plan to reboot all the time, I take this as a win.\n\nFirst, Install preload.\n\n```\nsudo apt-get install preload\n```\n\nOnce installed, let’s go and change some of the settings to make it a bit more aggressive loading libraries and applications in ram. You can find the changes I made below here. I am still experimenting with it, so feel free to leave defaults or tweak as you prefer.\n\nLet’s open preload configuration file.\n\n```\nsudo nano /etc/preload.conf\n```\n\nThese are the lines I modified, so far I am quite happy with the results.\n\n```\nminsize 100000\nmapprefix = !/var/log;!/dev;!/var/tmp;!/tmp;/\nexeprefix = !/var/log;!/dev;!/var/tmp;!/tmp;/\nautosave = 360\nsortstrategy = 0\n```\n\n## Reboot and test\n\nThat should be enough tweaks for now. Time for a good old reboot. Fingers crossed. After reboot, let’s have a look around and see if any of the changes were applied.\n\n### Checking CPU and GPU settings\n\nFrom Budgie ARM TweakTool, I can see that my CPU is now running at 2.0Ghz and temperatures are still quite low. This is thanks to the big heatsink and fan combo, the nice aluminum case that acts as another big heatsink, and allows for good airflow.\n\n### Checking ramdisks\n\nLet’s see if our ramdisks have been created, are running and what the used space for each one is.\n\n```\ndf -h\n```\n\nI can clearly see that /var/log , /var/tmp , and /tmp are now in ramdisk (tmpfs), and that they are only using around 1% of max space:\n\n```\nFilesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on\ntmpfs           738M   13M  725M   2% /run\n/dev/mmcblk0p2  117G  9.8G  103G   9% /\ntmpfs           3.7G   38M  3.6G   2% /dev/shm\ntmpfs           5.0M  4.0K  5.0M   1% /run/lock\ntmpfs           4.0M     0  4.0M   0% /sys/fs/cgroup\ntmpfs           3.7G     0  3.7G   0% /run/qemu\ntmpfs           500M  740K  500M   1% /tmp\ntmpfs           500M  396K  500M   1% /var/log\ntmpfs           500M     0  500M   0% /var/tmp\n/dev/mmcblk0p1  253M   96M  158M  38% /boot/firmware\ntmpfs           738M  168K  738M   1% /run/user/1000\n```\n\n### Checking disk I/O\n\nI also want to have a look at disk writes using glances and iotop. I see reduced activity in my microSD I/O. You can install those easily in Ubuntu Budgie.\n\n```\nsudo apt-get install glances iotop\n```\n\n## Conclusion\n\n\u003Cfigure>\n\n![Mg Ubuntubudgie Arm 04 744x558 1](images/mg-ubuntubudgie-arm-04-744x558-1.jpg)\n\n\u003Cfigcaption>\n\nFinal view of running system\n\n\u003C/figcaption>\n\n\u003C/figure>\n\nVictory! Everything works fine, my system is doing way less writes to disk, and overall feels faster loading the applications I use often. I have to admit, I did not expect this would run as good as it does. I find its performance to be acceptable for everyday use. It is very cheap, it uses very little power, and it is super quiet. Plus, it runs Ubuntu Budgie, what can I ask more?\n\nSpecial thanks to Sam and David for delivering this amazing Ubuntu Budgie ARM.

Long Term Releases such as 20.04.3 provide assured stability over a longer term (3 yrs) than a standard 9 month release. Critical and stability fixes will be released for all the supported Ubuntu Budgie components; these will be undertaken by ourselves, Canonical and the wider Ubuntu community.\n\nIn these release notes the areas covered are:\n\n- New features and enhancements\n- Upgrading from 20.04.3/21.04 Ubuntu Budgie\n- Known Issues when upgrading\n- Where to download Ubuntu Budgie\n\n![Desktop2104 744x419 1](images/desktop2104-744x419-1.jpg)\n\n## Summary\n\nUbuntu Budgie is the sum of many hundreds of developers working together. For 21.10 your Ubuntu Budgie team have primarily concentrated on our window management system called Shuffler and we are very excited to share the great new features\n\nFor 21.10 we now have also produced our second Raspberry Pi 4 image – this has continued to be refined. Do checkout the [README](https://sourceforge.net/projects/budgie-remix/files/budgie-raspi-21.10/) – the optional optimisations really make a difference with a 8Gb Raspi model.\n\n![Image 1617287845572](images/image-1617287845572.png)\n\nBudgie Desktop has now been uplifted to v10.5.3. We are pleased as a team to have contributed to this release – the results from the whole budgie developer community really shows in 21.10\n\n… and for fun we now include a Windows 11 like optional layout.\n\n![Image 1632331337435 744x418 1](images/image-1632331337435-744x418-1.png)\n\nOur desktop has been refreshed – we now sport a revamped dark theme with GTK+4 support. Windows Shuffler now auto-moves and arranges windows.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPjxmY\\_OAGo\n\nTaken together, all the smaller changes plus the larger enhancements shapes our distro to be fully flexible and customisable to your workflow; with sane defaults to provide a first rate experience from the get-go.\n\n## Applets and mini-apps\n\nSummary of changes:\n\n1. Lots of updated translations from our brilliant translators [https://www.transifex.com/ubuntu-budgie/](https://www.transifex.com/ubuntu-budgie/)\n2. Fix for spamming the syslog when previews was enabled but end-user was logged into a wayland desktop session\n3. Fix for WIndow Shuffler layouts executable installation path to work on stateless distros\n4. Window Shuffler Control has been completely revamped and redesigned\n\n\u003Cfigure>\n\n![Shuffler Control 1 744x471 1](images/shuffler_control_1-744x471-1.png)\n\n\u003Cfigcaption>\n\nShuffler Control  \n\n\u003C/figcaption>\n\n\u003C/figure>\n\n5\\. Window Shuffler now includes an applet to (re-) arrange and automatically move windows, either a single window or a group of windows.\n\n\u003Cfigure>\n\n![Shufflerapplet E1632380421472](images/shufflerapplet-e1632380421472.png)\n\n\u003Cfigcaption>\n\nShuffler applet\n\n\u003C/figcaption>\n\n\u003C/figure>\n\n6\\.

Applications Menu – Calculator now shows a visual hint how to copy the result to the clipboard. Try it – press Super then enter 2+2\n\n9\\. Applications Menu – transition from Grid to List modes is now a fade rather than a slide animation\n\n10\\. We no longer install the elementary gsettings schema – this ensures we don’t clash with a pantheon install. The elementary schema entry is now found in the budgie applications schema.\n\n11\\. Some themes space the category list oddly. We now have a user configurable override (adjust category spacing) in the applet settings allowing you to control the spacing.\n\n![Image 1632331489673](images/image-1632331489673.png)\n\n12\\. Fix where after connecting to a VPN spinner cursor was still showing\n\n13\\. Budgie Calendar Applet changes: Handle correctly the display of AM/PM when using custom date formats. Also backported to 20.04/20.10\n\n14\\. Budgie Calendar Applet changes: Select the current date when opening the popover. Also backported to 20.04/20.10\n\n15\\. Budgie Calendar Applet changes: How & Hide current week option. Also backported to 20.04/20.10\n\n16\\. v0.7.0 of budgie-indicator-applet has been released. This has a fix (hopefully) for any appindicator that used to display big/huge icons\n\n17\\. New applet called CPU Temp that displays the temperature of various sensors. It has been backported to 20.04, 20.10 & 21.04 as well.\n\n![Image 1632331576556](images/image-1632331576556.png)\n\n18\\. Thanks to contributor Akira ([https://github.com/AkiraMiyakoda](https://github.com/AkiraMiyakoda)) budgie-pixel-saver-applet has now received a number of enhancements:\n\n- Drag – drop to unmaximise\n- Configurable title theming\n- Updates to ensure work with arc-theme\n- Increase configurable title width to 200px\n- Allow right alignment of title\n- revamped theming support for window controls\n- new style class \"pixelsaver\" to aid theme maintainers\n\nThese changes are now available in 20.04/21.04 & 21.10\n\n19\\. VisualSpace – we now display a hint when you open the popover – scrolling over the panel icon changes the workspace.\n\n20\\. Brightness Controller has now been reworked to use GNOMEs dbus control … so this should be all distro friendly and will reflect accurately the same Power slider in GNOME Settings.\n\n## Budgie Desktop\n\n[Budgie 10.5.3](https://github.com/solus-project/budgie-desktop/releases/tag/v10.5.3) is a minor release that introduces fixes for bugs, various quality-of-life improvements, and support for the GNOME 40 stack.\n\n### Bug Fixes and Cleanup\n\nBudgie 10.5.3 introduces fixes to Budgie panel applets, Raven, and various window state tracking.\n\n- Drop use of Queue and Cancellable in Raven’s NotificationView.\n    - Instead of using a Queue (which is not thread safe anyways), just update a reference to a NotificationWindow since we only really cared about the head of the Queue to begin with.\n    - Dropped Cancellable usage for async pixbuf scaling. There has not really been a scenario yet where we have not been able to scale an icon within the amount of time before a NotificationWindow is removed.\n- Fix application icons not scaling in Raven’s Notification Group headers.\n- Fix issue with VirtualBox icon not being displayed in IconTaskList applet\n- Fix regression in Budgie Desktop Settings icon handling.\n- MPRIS metadata, playback status, and CanGoPrevious / CanGoNext fetching is now performed immediately rather than being an unnecessary idle operation.\n- Notifications now use a high priority timeout.\n- Notification iconography now uses a consistent `IconSize.DIALOG` instead of `IconSize.INVALID` and only scales if the icon provided is not already the desired height.\n- Prevent Budgie Desktop Settings from being pinned via drag-and-drop, fixing an issue where Budgie Desktop Settings was inadvertently pinnable and unable to be unpinned.\n- Sound Indicator applet and Raven\n    - Use standard mute/unmute methods, fixing issues like muting with media keys and then trying to unmute via the applet, which would previously not work.\n- System Tray applet\n    - Fix issue with KeePass causing panel segfaults.\n    - Various stability improvements, such as more proactive X11 error trapping.\n\n### GNOME 40 Support\n\nBudgie 10.5.3 introduces support for the GNOME 40 stack. GNOME 40 introduced various changes in Mutter, gsettings-desktop-schemas, and gnome-shell which impacted the ability to use Budgie under a GNOME 40 stack or in conjunction with GDM (GNOME’s login manager which leverages gnome-shell).\n\nWhen compiled alongside GNOME Settings Daemon 40.x, Budgie will use the migrated font anti-aliasing and hinting options, which were moved from `org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.xsettings` to `org.gnome.desktop.interface` . In [GNOME Shell](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-shell/-/commit/af5aff32514d7236d3261670a5ed0c087ee3abdd) and [GNOME Settings Daemon](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-settings-daemon/-/commit/f7702421321ff8aeeb2aad26afefee997b63e938) 40, there were changes introduced which impacted Budgie’s ability to use dedicated screensavers, such as gnome-screensaver (which we have been using since 2017). As always, we encourage that Budgie be used with lightdm and an optional greeter such as slick-greeter, as opposed to being installed alongside GDM and GNOME Shell where locking the screen is very hit-and-miss.\n\n### Quality-of-life Improvements\n\n\u003Cfigure>\n\n![Budgie Desktop Settings](images/budgie-desktop-settings.jpg)\n\n\u003Cfigcaption>\n\nBudgie Desktop Settings\n\n\u003C/figcaption>\n\n\u003C/figure>\n\nHere are some quality-of-life improvements shipping in Budgie 10.5.3\n\n- Filter out audacious notifications so they do not clutter up Raven.\n- Hide “Default”, which is typically Adwaita / GTK’s internal theme. We continue to encourage the use of theming that officially supports Budgie, such as Materia and Plata.\n- Mutter and WM preference schema settings are now only applied for Budgie session.\n- Spacing is now configurable in the Status applet.\n- The application fullscreen state tracking has been slightly rewritten to use the window XIDs, only call our track window state function on specific flags in the changed or current state, and reducing instances where some unset flags would not result in the application being removed as a fullscreen application.\n- There is now an option in Budgie and exposed via Budgie Desktop Settings’ “Windows” section to automatically pause notifications when a window is fullscreen and unpause when there no longer is a fullscreen window. This is useful in reducing distractions when gaming or watching content!\n- To improve the default user experience of Budgie on some downstream operating systems such as Arch Linux, Budgie now ships with a default wallpaper, eliminating the need for downstreams to apply supplemental changes or ship a wallpaper package.\n- We will no longer filter device added / removed notifications. This resolves issues where ejection notifications for external media would not get stored in Raven’s Notifications section.\n- When `xdotool` is available on the operating system, the Lock Keys applet can be clicked to toggle CapsLock and NumLock!\n\n## Raspberry Pi\n\nChanges for 21.10:\n\n1. Added support for the Compute Module 4 board\n2. Add `--force-arm-mode` command line option\n3. Add `--force-findpi-mode` command line option\n4. Add `--force-model modelname` command line option\n5. Add `--model modelname —cpuinfo “CPU String to Match”`\n6. Disable buttons and provide hint on Display tab if pibootctl is not found\n7. Disable buttons and provide hint on Overclock tab if no ‘/boot/firmware/config.txt’\n8. Enhanced the various option discoverability by using mouse hover and displaying a hint in a ‘status area’\n\n## Themes\n\n1. Snaps have been produced for [QogirBudgie](https://snapcraft.io/gtk-theme-qogirbudgie) and [Pocillo](https://snapcraft.io/gtk-theme-pocillo) GTK Themes – this means you can now theme snaps that are themable\n2. GTK+4 compatible version of WhiteSur available in Makeovers – backported to 20.04/20.10 & 21.04. Available to install on 21.10\n3. GTK+4 compatible version of QogirBudgie available in Makeovers\n4. GTK+4 compatible version of Vimix Theme available in Makeovers – backported to 21.04 and available to install on 21.10\n5. GTK+4 compatible version of Mojave Theme available in Makeovers – backported to 21.04 and available to install on 21.10\n6. GTK+4 compatible version of Pocillo Theme available\n7. Updated our default Pocillo icon theme with lots of new icons\n8. Updated Whitesur icon theme with lots of new icons\n\n## Budgie Welcome\n\n1. Lots of updated translations from our brilliant translators [https://www.transifex.com/ubuntu-budgie/](https://www.transifex.com/ubuntu-budgie/)\n2. Welcome snap no longer is updated from end-of-support 18.04. A message is now displayed when running on 16.04/18.04 & unrecognised distros\n3. Welcome has now been uplifted to core20 (focal) which ensures long-term compatibility with future Ubuntu Budgie versions – this ends all support for 16.04/18.04 (32bit) since it cannot be installed on these legacy versions.\n\n## Additional\n\n1. A couple of fixes to budgie-desktop-environment has been made to make budgie more friendly to other desktop environments / remote access that use dash as the default shell.\n2. Nemo Previews now available as a recommended app in Budgie Welcome to allow you to visualise the content of a highlighted file. Just press Space to toggle the viewer in Nemo. Backported to 20.04 & 20.10 as well.\n3. IRC links in Budgie Welcome now point to Libera Chat since the Ubuntu family has ended its association with Freenode.\n4. We have uploaded v0.8.3 of the Drawing application.\n5. The UB teams 21.10 wallpapers are now on the daily ISO. Eclectic as always… enjoy!\n\n6\\. Right click on a picture via Nemo has a \"Set as wallpaper\" menu option. This now has a fix to set both the desktop wallpaper and the lock-screen wallpaper at the same time. Previously only the desktop wallpaper was updated.\n\n7\\. GNOME 40 and later utilises the same super alt left/right keys combination to change workspaces that we also need for Shuffler to shift windows. For Ubuntu Budgie we use a gsetting override to revert to keybindings to that as used prior to GNOME 40.\n\n### Areas to look out for\n\n1. Kernel 5.13 is now the default in impish. Do look out for this – remember its the key part of any linux distro so issues need to be reported … not worked around! [https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux](http://pad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux)\n2. Note – from 22.04 Canonical & Mozilla will be enforcing all flavours to swap to using the [snap version of Firefox](https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/feature-freeze-exception-seeding-the-official-firefox-snap-in-ubuntu-desktop/24210). For 21.10 we will default to the usual Debian package install. **We do encourage all 21.10 users** to start using the snap version now and feedback your finding back to Canonical so that 22.04 will be as problem free as possible. Don’t forget you can [Pocillo](https://snapcraft.io/gtk-theme-pocillo) & [QogirBudgie](https://snapcraft.io/gtk-theme-qogirbudgie) theme all compatible snaps as well.\n\n### KEY FEATURES AVAILABLE TO UB FROM UBUNTU\n\n- Linux kernel v5.13\n- GNOME 40 applications and some GNOME 41 applications\n- Latest version of LibreOffice 7.2\n\nWhat does all that mean – most cutting edge yet stable software that brings great benefits for brand new hardware compatibility – including support for the very latest games.\n\n### UB MAINTAINED PACKAGES\n\nApart from the above (!) UB maintains many Debian packages. New versions available in 21.10 include:\n\n- Arc Theme\n- Rhythmbox Alternative Toolbar\n\n### KNOWN ISSUES\n\nIf you find that after the upgrade clicking the menu button crashes the panel, then CTRL+ALT+T to open a terminal then run:\n\n```\n  nohup budgie-panel --reset --replace &\n```\n\nLaunching terminal based apps from the menu does not work. Workaround is to fool GLib to assume that a supported terminal (tilix isnt supported) is installed `sudo ln -s /usr/bin/tilix /usr/bin/nxterm`. [](https://eu6.proxysite.com/process.php?d=0ae2pAg9L6aKEgCkK783cLnJIiNR%2Ba1%2FuQAv5jqh1qTSkA%2FbP33RqEfcua%2FWwM%2B0qFr%2BLd2vxObwysPMx9tm56A%3D&b=1)[https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/budgie-desktop/+bug/1873428](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/budgie-desktop/+bug/1873428)\n\nPlease read the [Ubuntu Release](https://eu6.proxysite.com/process.php?d=0ae2pA4hO7bLCxOiIPIqYq3DeDga7u1n9AFu%2ByL%2BlKTVyBTWPiDa8FHevK%2Ba18%2FqrUHlOIGrlKKu0MM%3D&b=1) notes which covers issues common to all Ubuntu Flavors.\n\nThe raspi image with some types of HDMI monitors hangs on boot.

You should upgrade to 20.10 first, then to 21.04 before then upgrading to 21.10\n\n### HOW TO UPGRADE FROM 21.04 TO 21.10\n\nIMPORTANT: remember to double-check you have the following vital package before you upgrade:\n\n```\nsudo apt install ubuntu-budgie-desktop\n```\n\nA few days/week or two after the formal release of 21.10 in Oct you will be automatically offered a graphical prompt to upgrade.\n\nAlternatively, from a command line run:\n\n```\nupdate-manager\n```\n\nSome of the packages that were installed as part of the Ubuntu Budgie backports PPA (ppa:ubuntubudgie/backports) will be uninstalled as part of the upgrade. Use budgie-welcome to reinstall anything that is removed.\n\n* * *\n\nPlease refer to the community wiki for more help:\n\n[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Upgrades](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Upgrades)\n\nAlso, Ask Ubuntu has an excellent guide to help you upgrade:\n\n[http://askubuntu.com/questions/110477/how-do-i-upgrade-to-a-newer-version-of-ubuntu](http://askubuntu.com/questions/110477/how-do-i-upgrade-to-a-newer-version-of-ubuntu)\n\n### DOWNLOAD\n\nFinal release is available here: [https://ubuntubudgie.org/downloads/](https://ubuntubudgie.org/downloads/)\n\n### GETTING SUPPORT\n\nThanks to the generosity of discourse.org, our support site is the crucial site for all things Ubuntu Budgie.\n\nOne to bookmark [https://discourse.ubuntubudgie.org](https://discourse.ubuntubudgie.org)\n\nMore information can be found [here.](https://eu6.proxysite.com/process.php?d=0ae2pB8qPbvQCwOkIbs2ZfbCfiobv7I741pxoWC%2BxfjKgBHbNT%2FW8FfU%2Fa6S18motlziON0%3D&b=1)\n\n### INFRASTRUCTURE\n\nWe just wanted to thank our infrastructure sponsors who help us keep the lights on.\n\n### [DIGITAL OCEAN](https://www.digitalocean.com/)\n\nOn a mission to simplify cloud computing so developers and their teams can spend more time building software that changes the world.\n\n### [DISCOURSE](https://www.discourse.org/)\n\nDiscourse is the 100% open source discussion platform built for the next decade of the Internet.

And how could we miss it? As soon as we saw it, we asked David to get it in our \"Themes and Layouts\" Application. Before we knew it, David included it, and by now all users of 20.04, 21.04 and 21.10 should have it available. Let's check it out!\n\n## Orchis theme overview\n\nThis is a very elegant and smooth theme, with rounded corners, and many different options for colors and materials. It looks familiar, but at the same time slightly different from most GTK themes. We can have a quick look at Orchis theme defaults below here.\n\n![This image shows default settings of Orchis theme](images/mg-orchis-01-744x384.png)  \n\n## Orchis theme installation\n\nInstalling Orchis theme is very easy. All we need to do is open our Budgie Welcome app, and select \"Themes & Layouts\". Another way to reach this application, is to open Budgie menu and select \"Themes & Layouts\".\n\n![This image shows default settings of Orchis theme, with Budgie Welcome application](images/mg-orchis-02-744x384.png)  \n\nOnce we open \"Themes & Layouts\", all we need to do is scroll down until we find Orchis, click to install it, and when ready click to apply makeover. As part of this makeover, we also get tela-circle-icon-theme and vimix-cursors. What a great combination, and all three components of this makeover are created by Vinceliuice. Once the makeover is complete, it is a good idea to relog or reboot, to make sure all changes are applied.\n\n![This image shows Ubuntu Budgie's \"Themes & Layouts\" application](images/mg-orchis-03-744x384.png)\n\n## Orchis theme tweaks\n\nKeep in mind that Orchis defaults are not hard coded in the theme, but just one of the many options and color schemes available with this theme pack. We can, for example, quickly turn this into a dark theme. If we want we can also switch icon styles to those we prefer. In order to do this, we need to open our Budgie menu, and select \"Budgie Desktop Settings\"\n\nWhat we need to change, is the \"Widgets\" style. Other options such as \"Icons\", \"Cursors\", and \"Notification Position\" are readily available in this menu. As we can see, our default is Orchis-light-compact. Let's go ahead and make it a dark theme instead!\n\n![This image shows Budgie Desktop Settings, where we can change our theme's appearance](images/mg-orchis-04-744x384.png)  \n\nWow, so many choices here. List of different styles and accents, for both light and dark versions is impressive. For this quick write up, I am going to stick to the regular Orchis-dark-compact, but feel free to experiment.\n\n![This image shows Budgie Desktop Settings and all available variations to the Orchis theme](images/mg-orchis-05-744x384.png)  \n\nI can see that most of the settings are applied right away.

And how could we miss it? As soon as we saw it, we asked David to get it in our “Themes and Layouts” Application. Before we knew it, David included it, and by now all users of 20.04, 21.04 and 21.10 should have it available.

We can, for example, quickly turn this into a dark theme. If we want we can also switch icon styles to those we prefer. In order to do this, we need to open our Budgie menu, and select “Budgie Desktop Settings”\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>What we need to change, is the “Widgets” style. Other options such as “Icons”, “Cursors”, and “Notification Position” are readily available in this menu. As we can see, our default is Orchis-light-compact.

But do we really know what it offers? In this quick write up, I am going to walk you through all the features of this small but very useful Welcome application.\n\nBudgie Welcome is a Snap application. There has been quite some development time on it lately. If you want to check what the team has been up to, it is very easy to jump forward to development release (edge channel), either via Software GUI, or by running this command:\n\n```\nsnap refresh --edge ubuntu-budgie-welcome\n```\n\n![Mg Budgie Welcome 01](images/mg-budgie-welcome-01-744x547.jpg) Software Center - Ubuntu Budgie Welcome Snap Channels\n\n## Let's have a look at the left side of our Budgie Welcome Application.\n\n### Introduction and Features\n\nIntroduction and Features are a couple of very nice pages, created with the purpose of giving a new user a quick look of what this distribution has to offer.\n\n![Mg Budgie Welcome 03](images/mg-budgie-welcome-03-744x661.jpg) Introduction\n\n![Mg Budgie Welcome 04](images/mg-budgie-welcome-04-744x661.jpg) Features\n\n### Getting Started\n\nWhen we open Getting Started, we see a lot of very useful features. I always open this menu after a new installation of Ubuntu Budgie, so I can quickly install browsers, drivers, check options, software, and settings.\n\n![Mg Budgie Welcome 05](images/mg-budgie-welcome-05-744x661.jpg) Getting Started\n\n#### Browser Ballot\n\nMost browsers are represented here. In some cases, there is even both choice of snap and regular debian package install. If some external repositories are needed to install a particular browser, a quick menu informs the user and everything is done automatically.\n\n![Mg Budgie Welcome 06](images/mg-budgie-welcome-06-744x661.jpg) Browser Ballot\n\n#### Customization\n\nVery useful shortcuts to \"Budgie Desktop Settings\", where we can tweak our Budgie related settings, such as appearance, desktop, panels, and more.\n\nThere is also a shortcut to \"Settings\" which opens Operative system settings, such as Network, Bluetooth, Notifications, Sound, Power, Displays, Printers and more.\n\n![Mg Budgie Welcome 07](images/mg-budgie-welcome-07-744x661.jpg) Customization\n\n#### Keyboard Shortcuts\n\nUseful menu to check default keyboard shortcuts for Ubuntu Budgie.\n\n![Mg Budgie Welcome 08](images/mg-budgie-welcome-08-744x661.jpg) Shortcuts\n\n#### Updates and Extras\n\nHere we can check system updates, and install Ubuntu restricted extras for codecs and other non-free media formats.\n\n![Mg Budgie Welcome 09](images/mg-budgie-welcome-09-744x661.jpg) Updates and Extras\n\n#### Drivers\n\nA very useful page that shows us what GPU we have, if installed drivers are optimized. There is also a link to \"Additional Drivers\", which is useful for those that need proprietary drivers, such as NVIDIA cards.\n\n![Mg Budgie Welcome 10](images/mg-budgie-welcome-10-744x661.jpg) Drivers\n\n#### Language and Input\n\nLanguage and Input is great for my personal use. I type in different languages, and I also need Traditional Chinese input, which could be a bit of a hassle in some distributions. With Ubuntu Budgie, I click on the Complex Input I want, leave iBus active, and that's pretty much it. There is also a link to \"Language Support\" where I can check Installed Languages, and formats.\n\n![Mg Budgie Welcome 11](images/mg-budgie-welcome-11-744x661.jpg) Language and Input\n\n#### Optional Tasks\n\nA few but important tasks are recommended here. Backups and Firewall are very important for everyone. I urge everyone to spend a few moments and make sure they have backups and firewall enabled. There is also a shortcut to \"Configure Users\", in case you need to add users to your system.\n\n![Mg Budgie Welcome 12](images/mg-budgie-welcome-12-744x661.jpg) Optional Tasks\n\n#### System Specifications\n\nThis menu will open a quick overview of your system, where you can check your distribution, kernel, Motherboard, CPU, RAM, Storage, and more.\n\n![Mg Budgie Welcome 13](images/mg-budgie-welcome-13-744x661.jpg) System Specifications\n\n## Moving to the right side of our Budgie Welcome Application\n\n### Online Store\n\nThis page shows us a quick overview of what is available on our Merch store, if you want to support the project and spread the word, you can click on the bottom icon \"Ubuntu Budgie Online Store\".\n\n![Mg Budgie Welcome 14](images/mg-budgie-welcome-14-744x857.jpg) Online Store\n\n### Community\n\nIn this page you can find support channels such as discourse, IRC, Ask Ubuntu forums. There are also links to social media, and local communities.\n\n![Mg Budgie Welcome 15](images/mg-budgie-welcome-15-744x747.jpg) Community\n\n### Get Involved\n\nThis page does a great job explaining our users how they can get involved, help the project, and join the community. There are also links to Ubuntu Budgie Launchpad, Ubuntu Budgie GitHub, Budgie Desktop Github. Last but not least, The \"Opportunities\" Icon brings us to a page that has very specific lists of items the team needs help with.\n\n![Mg Budgie Welcome 16](images/mg-budgie-welcome-16-744x747.jpg) Get Involved\n\n### Donate\n\nIf you want to make a single or recurring donation to either PayPal or Patreon, click on this page and follow the links.\n\n![Mg Budgie Welcome 17](images/mg-budgie-welcome-17-744x747.jpg) Donate\n\n## We are now going to take a look at the items at the bottom of our Budgie Welcome application.\n\n### Install Software\n\nThis is a very useful menu, that presents many ways to install software in your Ubuntu Budgie install:\n\n- Budgie Extras: All the Ubuntu Budgie applets you might ever want. All bundled here, in the distribution, updated and tested for the specific release you installed.\n- Recommendations: A few recommended packages\n- Software Center: This is Gnome software center, which is used in the Budgie Desktop Environment\n- Snap Apps: If you want to install Snap applications, this link takes you to snapcraft store.\n- Flatpak Apps: If you want to install Flatpak applications, this link takes you to flathub.\n- Gaming: This is a new entry, completely dedicated to gaming. You will read all about this on a separate blog post.\n\n![Mg Budgie Welcome 20](images/mg-budgie-welcome-20-744x745.jpg) Budgie Extras\n\n![Mg Budgie Welcome 23](images/mg-budgie-welcome-23-744x538.jpg) Gaming\n\n### Themes and Layouts\n\nThis is the place to go if you like to automatically switch layouts to try something familiar, or perhaps you feel adventurous and want to try a different approach to your workflow. With themes, you can apply different window colors, icons, and fonts.\n\n![Mg Budgie Welcome 21](images/mg-budgie-welcome-21-744x745.jpg) Themes\n\n![Mg Budgie Welcome 22](images/mg-budgie-welcome-22-744x745.jpg) Layouts\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis was a quick overview of Budgie Welcome application. I have been using Ubuntu Budgie for years, and I still find this useful. I love it, and I am very proud to say that every time I show Ubuntu Budgie to a new user, they all appreciate it, especially in the first few weeks, as they get familiar with their new Operative System.\n\nGive it a try, tell us what you think, and remember, it is all FOSS. Our code is on GitHub. If you have ideas, recommendations, or even better, you want to help, don't be shy and get in touch with us.\n\nLast but not least, I want to take a moment to thank all the great contributors to our Budgie Welcome app. Since there is a long list and I don't want to miss anyone, please [check this link to GitHub contributors](https://github.com/UbuntuBudgie/budgie-welcome/graphs/contributors \"check this link to GitHub contributors\").","src/content/blog/2022/02/quick-overview-of-budgie-welcome-application.md",[2822,2823,2824,2825,2826,2827,2828,2829,2830,2831,2832,2833,2834,2835,2836,2837,2838,2839,2840,2841,2842],"images/mg-budgie-welcome-02-744x439.jpg","images/mg-budgie-welcome-01-744x547.jpg","images/mg-budgie-welcome-03-744x661.jpg","images/mg-budgie-welcome-04-744x661.jpg","images/mg-budgie-welcome-05-744x661.jpg","images/mg-budgie-welcome-06-744x661.jpg","images/mg-budgie-welcome-07-744x661.jpg","images/mg-budgie-welcome-08-744x661.jpg","images/mg-budgie-welcome-09-744x661.jpg","images/mg-budgie-welcome-10-744x661.jpg","images/mg-budgie-welcome-11-744x661.jpg","images/mg-budgie-welcome-12-744x661.jpg","images/mg-budgie-welcome-13-744x661.jpg","images/mg-budgie-welcome-14-744x857.jpg","images/mg-budgie-welcome-15-744x747.jpg","images/mg-budgie-welcome-16-744x747.jpg","images/mg-budgie-welcome-17-744x747.jpg","images/mg-budgie-welcome-20-744x745.jpg","images/mg-budgie-welcome-23-744x538.jpg","images/mg-budgie-welcome-21-744x745.jpg","images/mg-budgie-welcome-22-744x745.jpg","3a9416cfca9c9fe3",{"html":2845,"metadata":2846},"\u003Cp>\u003Cimg __ASTRO_IMAGE_=\"{&#x22;src&#x22;:&#x22;images/mg-budgie-welcome-02-744x439.jpg&#x22;,&#x22;alt&#x22;:&#x22;Mg Budgie Welcome 02&#x22;,&#x22;index&#x22;:0}\"> Budgie Welcome Application\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Budgie Welcome is the first thing we see when we boot a Live ISO, and after we complete our install.

If you want to check it, you can have a look at [this discourse post](https://discourse.ubuntubudgie.org/t/ubuntu-budgie-22-04-wallpaper-contest/5501 \" this discourse post \")\n\nThis was my first community powered wallpaper contest, and honestly I was not expecting such an incredible response from our community. There were some amazing submissions, actually so many great pictures that it took us quite a while to sort them, filter by resolution and quality, and get them ready for the contest.\n\n## Pictures Quality and noise issues\n\nAs we were arranging pictures, we noticed that a few had a very high amount of noise, and even if those were awesome pictures with great resolution, looking at them from a 4K monitor was less than ideal.\n\nAs I said, some of those pictures were really good. So good that we did not want to disqualify them from our contest just because of some noise. David and Jacob tried to run some denoise filters with various applications, but the result was less than ideal, as noise was replaced with blur.\n\nAs we were losing hope, our team member Nikola came to the rescue. He fired up some magic, AI-powered photo software, ran all the pictures through it and after a few hours, we got the processed pictures. So far, this project has been full of surprises. We immediately saw that most of the noise was removed or greatly reduced, and all pictures looked great even on our ultra-wide and 4K monitors. What an excellent example of good use of AI software.\n\n## Challenging times with pictures selection\n\nWith renewed energy, Jacob and I continued with our work. Nothing could stop us, we were energized, happy, and motivated. The task at hand was simple, we were to select 10 pictures. Wait, what? Ten? We soon realized that our mission looked simple, but it was quite an impossible one. I started with 24 pictures, Jacob had 29, and we thought we did not want to remove any.\n\nOur great momentum stopped, we soon called for a video chat, where it was mostly Jacob and myself scratching our heads and trying to justify why we could not remove this or that picture.\n\nSo many great submissions, so much effort from our beloved community, how could we? How could we betray and disappoint them, by removing the great pictures they sent us? This was not working. We got stuck.\n\nThen, after a bit of mumbling and grumbling, we finally decided to change our approach. How about we don't consider discarding pictures, but voting for the best ones? Let's for a moment pretend they all make it into the wallpaper list, just pick the ones we like the most.\n\nThat sounded like a more positive approach, and soon the discussion was started. First, we needed a bit more variety. We noticed we had quite a few landscapes, a few macro pictures of flowers and insects. But we had too many with green backgrounds and definitely too many with water.\n\nIt was Jacob's time to rescue us this time. He is also a hobbyist photographer, and he allowed us a few of his pictures. He happened to have a couple that were very different in both subject and colors, from our community submissions. Perfect! On top of that, Jacob made it very clear from the start that he was not participating in the contest, he only wanted to help but not take any prize.\n\nFinally we had a very good selection with nice variety. Then, Jacob came up with a good plan. Both of us had to choose 16 of the pictures we liked the most. We would both vote for our favorite pictures, with heavier weight for the ones we liked the most, downwards. We combined our selections, ran the numbers, and surprisingly we agreed with quite a few of the pictures in our respective lists. From final results, we still had 16 which was still too much compared to the target of 10.\n\nOh, reality is bad sometimes, did we have to keep eliminating 6 awesome pictures? I admit that last part of the project was the hardest. When we reached 12 pictures, we had nowhere left to go. Nothing we were willing to give up and remove from our wallpaper selection.\n\n## Mutiny!\n\nThis time it was my turn to have a brilliant idea. How about we keep 12 and don't tell David? After all, he might just not notice the difference between 10 and 12, such similar numbers. And developers are not that good with math anyway.... Hmm, I felt somehow my logic was not very sound, but we tried nonetheless.\n\nWell, our deception did not last long, as David noticed the difference immediately. However we had a few excuses lined up and we managed to convince him our choice was the best.\n\nActually, it is more likely that David was tired of listening to our blabbering, and being the awesome guy he is, he granted our wish. 22.04 will have 12 pictures in its wallpaper list. On top of that, since we had so many awesome images, David suggested we should also gift sticker packs to all the artists that had pictures selected.\n\n## Contest winners\n\nTime to roll the drums, here we are with our final selection:\n\n![Mg 22 04 Wallpaper Winners](images/mg-22_04-wallpaper-winners-744x564.jpg)\n\nAnd the winners are:\n\n- **1st place:** Sigisagi\n- **2nd place:** Marxpresso\n- **3rd place:** Gregor\n- **4th place:** Bakpaul\n- **Special guest:** Jacob\n\n## Honorable mentions\n\nA few honorable mentions, we would like to thank all artists that submitted awesome pictures we loved: Frossty, S12wu, Eizen, MLampner, Radugalan, Puffettacicciottella, Coeur-Noir, NeonDemon318, Storm, Raxelgrande.\n\n## Contest rewards and conclusion\n\nPer our initial discourse post, 1st place will receive US$50 worth of merchandise from Ubuntu Budgie store. All other winners and our special guest, will get a sticker pack from our Ubuntu Budgie store.\n\nLast but not least, all participants of this contest that submitted pictures, do get Ubuntu Budgie team's gratitude. Thank you all for being awesome. You all had great pictures and allowed us to run them through our contest. If your picture was not selected, don't feel too bad. We had a very hard time choosing only twelve from so many excellent pictures. Our recommendation for next contest, is to check picture resolution, noise, and variety.\n\nThis was a great community project. I can't wait for our 22.04 LTS to be out, so we can show off our community's beautiful wallpapers.","src/content/blog/2022/02/ubuntu-budgie-22-04-wallpaper-contest.md",[2940,2941],"images/mg-22_04-wallpaper-featured.jpeg","images/mg-22_04-wallpaper-winners-744x564.jpg","abbf37fe71e3a2a2",{"html":2944,"metadata":2945},"\u003Cp>\u003Cimg __ASTRO_IMAGE_=\"{&#x22;src&#x22;:&#x22;images/mg-22_04-wallpaper-featured.jpeg&#x22;,&#x22;alt&#x22;:&#x22;Mg 22 04 Wallpaper Featured&#x22;,&#x22;index&#x22;:0}\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Ubuntu Budgie 22.04 LTS release is just around the corner, as the team is rushing to complete the last few tasks, I want to take a moment to write about my amazing experience with both our community and Ubuntu Budgie team.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"contest-starting-in-321\">Contest Starting in 3…2…1…\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>In November 2021, I posted about our wallpaper contest for 22.04 LTS release. If you want to check it, you can have a look at \u003Ca href=\"https://discourse.ubuntubudgie.org/t/ubuntu-budgie-22-04-wallpaper-contest/5501\" title=\" this discourse post \">this discourse post\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>This was my first community powered wallpaper contest, and honestly I was not expecting such an incredible response from our community. There were some amazing submissions, actually so many great pictures that it took us quite a while to sort them, filter by resolution and quality, and get them ready for the contest.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"pictures-quality-and-noise-issues\">Pictures Quality and noise issues\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>As we were arranging pictures, we noticed that a few had a very high amount of noise, and even if those were awesome pictures with great resolution, looking at them from a 4K monitor was less than ideal.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>As I said, some of those pictures were really good. So good that we did not want to disqualify them from our contest just because of some noise. David and Jacob tried to run some denoise filters with various applications, but the result was less than ideal, as noise was replaced with blur.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>As we were losing hope, our team member Nikola came to the rescue. He fired up some magic, AI-powered photo software, ran all the pictures through it and after a few hours, we got the processed pictures. So far, this project has been full of surprises. We immediately saw that most of the noise was removed or greatly reduced, and all pictures looked great even on our ultra-wide and 4K monitors. What an excellent example of good use of AI software.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"challenging-times-with-pictures-selection\">Challenging times with pictures selection\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>With renewed energy, Jacob and I continued with our work. Nothing could stop us, we were energized, happy, and motivated. The task at hand was simple, we were to select 10 pictures. Wait, what? Ten? We soon realized that our mission looked simple, but it was quite an impossible one. I started with 24 pictures, Jacob had 29, and we thought we did not want to remove any.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Our great momentum stopped, we soon called for a video chat, where it was mostly Jacob and myself scratching our heads and trying to justify why we could not remove this or that picture.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So many great submissions, so much effort from our beloved community, how could we? How could we betray and disappoint them, by removing the great pictures they sent us? This was not working. We got stuck.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Then, after a bit of mumbling and grumbling, we finally decided to change our approach. How about we don’t consider discarding pictures, but voting for the best ones? Let’s for a moment pretend they all make it into the wallpaper list, just pick the ones we like the most.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>That sounded like a more positive approach, and soon the discussion was started. First, we needed a bit more variety. We noticed we had quite a few landscapes, a few macro pictures of flowers and insects. But we had too many with green backgrounds and definitely too many with water.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>It was Jacob’s time to rescue us this time.

As you might know, our team has been working to improve gaming experience. I am here today to take you through our journey.\n\nSoon after I joined the team, mid 2021, I was discussing with David and Nikola about an idea to add gaming recommendations to our Ubuntu Budgie Welcome application. David immediately linked to a page on github where some work was done about the very same idea I had, a few years back. Unfortunately though, the work was not completed back then. However, David and the team showed support for the idea and encouraged me to give it a shot, see what our community thought.\n\nI soon after wrote a [discourse post about this project](https://discourse.ubuntubudgie.org/t/community-project-ubuntu-budgie-gaming/5225 \"discourse post about this project\"), outlined the scope and asked input and ideas from our community. At the same time I reached out to the person that started the discussion a few years back, Uday Narayan Mukherjee, aka \"HellBringer419\". I explained that we wanted to resume work on this and since he was the original creator and developer, I asked if he was interested in working with us on the project. Uday graciously agreed to help out and resume his work.\n\nWow, that was great news. This inspired me to help as much as I could, so I organized my discourse post to be a light version of project management document, while at the same time reaching out to a few enthusiast Linux gamers out there. First one to help, was Matt from Destination Linux Network, AKA Dark1LTG. Later, even Jason Evanghelo from Linux4Everyone got involved.\n\nOthers from our community shared some ideas and info, and the project quickly gained momentum. We had quite a list of awesome ideas, software we could not miss to add, and very positive attitude from our friends overall.\n\nWe decided to start with a few \"Quick Wins\", so that we could keep our morale high, and deliver immediate useful tools to our _Budgie Gaming_ application. Also, we outlined longer term goals that would take more effort and testing, and decided to leave those after the release of Ubuntu Budgie 22.04 LTS.\n\nI am very proud to say that it was an absolute pleasure working with our team and our community. Things were going so well, that after a few weeks working with Uday, I saw his positive attitude and FOSS oriented mind at work, and I offered him to join our team. Once again, he agreed and since then, our work has been even faster.\n\nDavid, our team leader, has been also working behind the scenes to help out with his magic coding skills and advice when we got stuck. David is really the unsung hero of Ubuntu Budgie, we all owe him a great deal.\n\nFast forward a few months of good work, and we finally managed to have a first polished release with version 0.17.0 of Budgie Welcome. Please note that latest changes are still in Edge Channel of our Budgie Welcome Snap. If you want to give it a try before 22.04 LTS is released, you will have to either swap to edge channel from \"Software\" GUI Application, or run this command from terminal:\n\n```\nsnap refresh --edge ubuntu-budgie-welcome\n```\n\nNow that we have latest version of Budgie Welcome, let's have a look at what is available.\n\n## Gaming Clients\n\nThis section is dedicated to our Linux native gaming clients. There are a few very important applications here for anyone that wants to play on Linux.\n\n### Steam\n\nSteam [https://store.steampowered.com](https://store.steampowered.com) is the gaming platform we all learned to love. Valve, the company behind Steam, has done amazing work for Linux gamers over the years. Together with Codeweavers [https://www.codeweavers.com](https://www.codeweavers.com), they released Proton. Thanks to Proton, we can play so many of our Windows games on Linux.\n\nIt is true that not everything works out of the box, but Proton is making great improvements, and with ProtonDB, it is very easy to check what works, what doesn't, and if a particular game needs extra tweaks to run smoothly. [https://www.protondb.com](https://www.protondb.com)\n\n![This image shows Steam store page](images/mg-budgiegaming-08-744x496.jpg) Steam Store page\n\n### Lutris\n\nAnother heavyweight of Linux Gaming, Lutris [https://lutris.net](https://lutris.net) is a great platform for Linux gaming. You can run most games in a variety of different ways via Lutris. On top of that, Lutris also has amazing forums [https://forums.lutris.net](https://forums.lutris.net) and great howtos [https://github.com/lutris/docs/blob/master/InstallingDrivers.md](https://github.com/lutris/docs/blob/master/InstallingDrivers.md) available to help all gamers. Destination Linux also did a great interview with founder of Lutris, Mathieu Comandon [https://destinationlinux.org/episode-255/](https://destinationlinux.org/episode-255/) .\n\n![This image shows Lutris](images/mg-budgiegaming-07-744x635.jpg) Lutris\n\n### RetroArch\n\nSome of us like the latest and greatest games. Others prefer to go Retro Gaming. That is what RetroArch is great for. Since it is a bit more involved, I recommend to check their home page for howtos and more information [https://www.retroarch.com](https://www.retroarch.com)\n\n![This image shows Retroarch webpage](images/mg-budgiegaming-09-744x332.jpg) Retroarch Webpage\n\n### MiniGalaxy\n\nMiniGalaxy is a GOG compatible client for Linux. If you have a lot of GOG games, this client is going to help you a great deal. Make sure to check their website if you need details or help. [https://sharkwouter.github.io/minigalaxy/](https://sharkwouter.github.io/minigalaxy/)\n\n![This image shows minigalaxy](images/mg-budgiegaming-10-744x524.jpg) Minigalaxy\n\n## Gaming Tools\n\nIn this section, you will find many tools and applications that will improve your gaming experience, or add some extra, gaming related functionality. CoreCTRL also adds a repository with updated mesa and drivers for Intel and AMD GPUs.\n\n### Piper\n\nPiper is a GTK application that uses libratbag to help you configure gaming mice. A list of supported devices can be found here. [https://github.com/libratbag/libratbag/tree/master/data/devices](https://github.com/libratbag/libratbag/tree/master/data/devices)\n\n![This image shows Piper setup page](images/mg-budgiegaming-13-744x498.jpg) Piper\n\n### CPU Frequency Applet\n\nUbuntu Budgie has an applet that help you configure CPU governor. This can be very useful for gaming and computer use in general. Once installed, you can add the applet to one of your Budgie panels using \"Budgie Desktop Settings\", going to \"Panels\", and adding the applet to one of your panels.\n\n![This image shows CPU frequency applet](images/mg-budgiegaming-14-744x443.jpg) CPU frequency applet\n\n### OpenRGB\n\nOpenRGB is an open source, cross platform application that helps you manage everything related to RGB. It comes with a nice and powerful GUI, a plugin system, and many nice features. Supported devices list is impressive [https://gitlab.com/CalcProgrammer1/OpenRGB/-/wikis/Supported-Devices](https://gitlab.com/CalcProgrammer1/OpenRGB/-/wikis/Supported-Devices). More details can be found visiting OpenRGB website [https://openrgb.org](https://openrgb.org)\n\n![This image shows OpenRGB](images/mg-budgiegaming-16-744x369.jpg) OpenRGB\n\n### Polychromatic & OpenRazer\n\nPolychromatic and OpenRazer deliver what in my opinion is the best experience for gaming related hardware. Razer hardware compatibility list is extensive and can be found here [https://openrazer.github.io/#devices](https://openrazer.github.io/#devices). Manual installation can be a bit involved, requiring many steps and also manually adding your user to a specific group. For this reason, we decided to put extra effort on this one. I am very happy to announce that all required steps are completely automated, including adding user to \"plugdev\" group during installation, and removing from the group when software is removed.\n\nCreating customized, game specific lighting effects with Polychromatic is easy and fun. All effects are easy to backup, but I appreciate the fact that there is no cloud, no accounts, no logins needed to use it. If you want to learn more, you can check my OpenRazer and Polychromatic article on Front Page Linux. [https://frontpagelinux.com/tutorials/control-your-razer-devices-on-linux-with-openrazer-polychromatic/](https://frontpagelinux.com/tutorials/control-your-razer-devices-on-linux-with-openrazer-polychromatic/)\n\n![This image shows Polychromatic software](images/mg-budgiegaming-20-744x542.jpg) Polychromatic\n### Discord\n\nDiscord is a very popular communication platform. It is not FOSS but it is what most gamers use. There are some papercuts with Discord Linux app, especially when a new version is detected. Depending on how user installed it, it could be impossible to start it at all, until a new version is released by package maintainers. For this reason, we decided to deploy it via Snap package. Being a Snap, it also ensures higher security and isolation from your operative system.\n\n![This image shows Discord installer in Budgie Gaming](images/mg-budgiegaming-17-1-744x340.jpg) Discord Installer\n\n### OBS Studio\n\nOBS studio is a Free and Open Source, multi platform software for video recording and streaming. Over the years, it became a standard application for gamers and streamers. It supports JACK audio, features many plugins, and is very customizable.\n\n![This image shows OBS Studio installer in Budgie Gaming](images/mg-budgiegaming-19-1-744x346.jpg) OBS Studio installer\n\n### GOverlay + Mango HUD\n\nMangoHud is a great tool for those that want to monitor CPU, GPU, FPS and more as they play their games. There are many configuration options and I strongly recommend to check out this project on github to learn more [https://github.com/flightlessmango/MangoHud#normal-usage](https://github.com/flightlessmango/MangoHud#normal-usage)\n\n![This image shows GOverlay](images/mg-budgiegaming-21-744x481.jpg) GOverlay\n\n### CoreCtrl\n\nCoreCtrl allows us to create hardware performance profiles, that can be automatically applied when an application is launched. This even works for Lutris games, Steam games, and yes even Windows games. There is a lot to learn, so I encourage everyone to go and check CoreCtrl gitlab page for more details.\n\nCoreCtrl for Ubuntu is brought to us by Ernst Sjöstrand. He created a PPA that also includes updated, but not bleeding edge versions of Mesa and video drivers for AMD GPUs. I have been using this PPA for months and I really love to have what he calls \"Mesa almost stable\". [You can check his PPA on Launchpad](https://launchpad.net/~ernstp/+archive/ubuntu/mesarc \"You can check his PPA on Launchpad\").\n\n![This image shows CoreCtrl profiles](images/mg-budgiegaming-22-744x530.jpg) CoreCtrl\n\n## Games List\n\nThis is a section dedicated to our community curated list of games. It is very interesting to note that we were also able to manage Steam games from here. Our Gaming app will automatically launch Steam Client for you, and then launch the game if it is on your library. If it is not on your library, Steam Store page for the game will open, so you can check it out and see if you are interested or not. I encourage everyone to give it a try. If Steam Client is not installed, our Gaming application will change behavior and present you with a different choice, to install Steam Client.\n\nFor our first release, our team filled the list with some titles we like. As there was a lot of work to do on our first release, together with upcoming 22.04 LTS, we did not have time to dedicate to this.\n\nOnce 22.04 LTS is out, we plan to have fun with our community, make some polls, vote for the games we want to be included.\n\n![This image shows Budgie Gaming, Games List tab](images/mg-budgiegaming-06-744x732.jpg) Budgie Gaming - Games List\n\n## Future Plans\n\nDon't worry, the fun does not stop here. We already have quite a few things planned for future releases. If you want to help out and get involved, you can drop us a message on discourse [https://discourse.ubuntubudgie.org](https://discourse.ubuntubudgie.org), or check our \"get involved\" [https://discourse.ubuntubudgie.org/c/get-involved/7](https://discourse.ubuntubudgie.org/c/get-involved/7)\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThere was quite a lot to go through and I hope you had fun checking what Ubuntu Budgie team is doing for Linux gamers. We certainly had a lot of fun getting this Gaming application up and running.\n\nI also want to take a moment to thank all the developers of the gaming clients and tools we added to our Gaming applications.

As you might know, our team has been working to improve gaming experience. I am here today to take you through our journey.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Soon after I joined the team, mid 2021, I was discussing with David and Nikola about an idea to add gaming recommendations to our Ubuntu Budgie Welcome application. David immediately linked to a page on github where some work was done about the very same idea I had, a few years back. Unfortunately though, the work was not completed back then. However, David and the team showed support for the idea and encouraged me to give it a shot, see what our community thought.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I soon after wrote a \u003Ca href=\"https://discourse.ubuntubudgie.org/t/community-project-ubuntu-budgie-gaming/5225\" title=\"discourse post about this project\">discourse post about this project\u003C/a>, outlined the scope and asked input and ideas from our community. At the same time I reached out to the person that started the discussion a few years back, Uday Narayan Mukherjee, aka “HellBringer419”. I explained that we wanted to resume work on this and since he was the original creator and developer, I asked if he was interested in working with us on the project. Uday graciously agreed to help out and resume his work.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Wow, that was great news. This inspired me to help as much as I could, so I organized my discourse post to be a light version of project management document, while at the same time reaching out to a few enthusiast Linux gamers out there. First one to help, was Matt from Destination Linux Network, AKA Dark1LTG. Later, even Jason Evanghelo from Linux4Everyone got involved.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Others from our community shared some ideas and info, and the project quickly gained momentum. We had quite a list of awesome ideas, software we could not miss to add, and very positive attitude from our friends overall.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>We decided to start with a few “Quick Wins”, so that we could keep our morale high, and deliver immediate useful tools to our \u003Cem>Budgie Gaming\u003C/em> application. Also, we outlined longer term goals that would take more effort and testing, and decided to leave those after the release of Ubuntu Budgie 22.04 LTS.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I am very proud to say that it was an absolute pleasure working with our team and our community. Things were going so well, that after a few weeks working with Uday, I saw his positive attitude and FOSS oriented mind at work, and I offered him to join our team. Once again, he agreed and since then, our work has been even faster.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>David, our team leader, has been also working behind the scenes to help out with his magic coding skills and advice when we got stuck. David is really the unsung hero of Ubuntu Budgie, we all owe him a great deal.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Fast forward a few months of good work, and we finally managed to have a first polished release with version 0.17.0 of Budgie Welcome.

For servers, we would need to dig a bit deeper in options, systemd services, timers, email notifications, automatic reboot, and more. Also, I strongly recommended to take system snapshots with Timeshift on a daily basis, and Clonezilla every month.\n\n## Goals\n\nOur goal is the following: Automate cleanup of old kernels, system updates, and cleanup of older kernels and packages.\n\nThis is a very useful thing to have on a desktop PC. I keep both linux-image-lowlatency as my primary kernel, and linux-image-generic as fallback. Because of that, I don't really need to keep 10+ copies of previous kernels on my desktop or laptop. This not only wastes space on my system, but in case of my commonly used setup, encrypted LVM, can be a major annoyance. Why?\n\nLVM partitions cannot be bootable, and a fully encrypted system, where even the boot partition is encrypted, Initial decrypt takes forever, and has no visual feedback. On Ubuntu desktop, and most flavours, /boot partition is a small, non-LVM and non encrypted partition. This helps a great deal with initial decrypt speed and it looks quite nice. However it is a small partition that fills up pretty quickly with old unused kernels. Manual cleanup is possible but I consider it a waste of time. Also if done without care, I could end up removing all the kernels from my system. And that would be less than ideal.\n\n## Check currently installed kernels\n\nRunning the command below, you can list how many kernels you have. If you never used unattended upgrades, you should see a long list of kernels.\n\n```\ndpkg --list | grep linux-image\n```\n\n## Configure Unattended Upgrades on Ubuntu Desktop or Flavours\n\n### Install and enable unattended upgrades\n\n```\nsudo apt install unattended-upgrades apt-listdifferences\n```\n\nConfigure the package, and select to automatically download updates when asked:\n\n```\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure -plow unattended-upgrades\n```\n\n### Fine-Tune Unattended Upgrades\n\nBackup default configuration file:\n\n```\ncp  /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/50unattended-upgrades  /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/50unattended-upgrades.bak\n```\n\nEdit this file:\n\n```\n /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/50unattended-upgrades\n```\n\nUncomment / change / add the following lines:\n\n```\nUnattended-Upgrade::Allowed-Origins {\n        \"${distro_id}:${distro_codename}\";\n        \"${distro_id}:${distro_codename}-security\";\n        // Extended Security Maintenance; doesn't necessarily exist for\n        // every release and this system may not have it installed, but if\n        // available, the policy for updates is such that unattended-upgrades\n        // should also install from here by default.\n        \"${distro_id}ESMApps:${distro_codename}-apps-security\";\n        \"${distro_id}ESM:${distro_codename}-infra-security\";\n        \"${distro_id}:${distro_codename}-updates\";\n//      \"${distro_id}:${distro_codename}-proposed\";\n        \"${distro_id}:${distro_codename}-backports\";\n};\n\nUnattended-Upgrade::Remove-Unused-Kernel-Packages \"true\";\nUnattended-Upgrade::Remove-New-Unused-Dependencies \"true\";\nUnattended-Upgrade::Remove-Unused-Dependencies \"true\";\n```\n\nLet's have a look at the options above. First of all we need to have Unattended-Upgrade fetch updates from all repositories but the proposed one. Proposed should stay commented for most users. Last 3 options to uncomment are specific to remove unused kernels and dependencies.\n\nThere is a lot more we can do with Unattended Upgrades but for Ubuntu Desktop, or flavours, this should be more than enough.\n\n## Final note on Unattended Upgrades\n\nIn order for Unattended Upgrades to do its job, you need to let it run on its own. If you manually upgrade every few hours, then Unattended Upgrades will never have the chance to do its magic.\n\nIf you want to manually see what it does, you can manually run Unattended Upgrades in verbose mode:\n\n```\nsudo apt update\nsudo unattended-upgrades -v\n```\n\nAfter a few days or weeks that it runs on its own, you can list your installed kernels again, and the list should be shorter. You can also check /boot size and notice a difference in size.\n\n```\ndpkg --list | grep linux-image\n```\n\nYou can also check /boot size and notice a difference in size.\n\n```\nsudo du -hc --max-depth=1 /boot\n```\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis quick write up was inspired by a question from one of our community members on Ubuntu Budgie Discourse. I thought it could be beneficial to write here, so that others could benefit from it.\n\n## References\n\n- [https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AutomaticSecurityUpdates](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AutomaticSecurityUpdates)\n- [https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RemoveOldKernels](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RemoveOldKernels)","src/content/blog/2022/03/automate-system-updates-on-ubuntu-desktop.md","6f818540ff68701a",{"html":3065,"metadata":3066},"\u003Ch2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Please note this configuration below is suitable for desktops.

This not only wastes space on my system, but in case of my commonly used setup, encrypted LVM, can be a major annoyance. Why?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>LVM partitions cannot be bootable, and a fully encrypted system, where even the boot partition is encrypted, Initial decrypt takes forever, and has no visual feedback. On Ubuntu desktop, and most flavours, /boot partition is a small, non-LVM and non encrypted partition. This helps a great deal with initial decrypt speed and it looks quite nice. However it is a small partition that fills up pretty quickly with old unused kernels. Manual cleanup is possible but I consider it a waste of time.

If you want to learn more, please see Release planning and scheduling, shared by Canonical on this post [https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/jammy-jellyfish-release-schedule/23906](https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/jammy-jellyfish-release-schedule/23906)\n\n- March 28: Beta Freeze, Hardware Enablement Freeze.\n- March 31: Beta.\n- April 07: Kernel Freeze, Non Language Pack Translation Deadline.\n- April 14: Final Freeze, Release Candidate, Language Pack Translation Deadline.\n- April 21: Final Release.\n- August 04: 22.04.1 Point Release.\n\n## New Features and Enhancements\n\n### Applets and mini-apps\n\n\\[caption id=\"attachment\\_2703\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"744\"\\]![This image shows Budgie hotcorners applet](images/mg-jammy-releasenotes-04-744x436.jpg) Budgie Desktop Settings: Hotcorners Applet\\[/caption\\]\n\n- Lots of updated translations from our brilliant translators: Transifex [https://www.transifex.com/ubuntu-budgie/](https://www.transifex.com/ubuntu-budgie/)\n- Latest version of budgie-calendar-applet (also backported to 22.04/21.10)\n- Budgie-indicator-applet has now swapped to support ayatana-indicators. This is the new upstream of the original ubuntu indicators.\n- ayatana-indicator-applet can be installed - this integrates with Evolution & Thunderbird (with the evolution plugin) to display appointments and calendar events\n- ayatana-webmail can be installed - this displays notifications in plank when an email is received.\n- budgie-applications-menu-applet: This has the following enhancements from upstream.\n    - App context menu available when right click from search results\n    - Reads the PrefersNonDefaultGPU setting from .desktop files and uses that to automatically configure default or non-default GPU\n    - Adds a new context menu to support choosing the other GPU (integrated if PrefersNonDefaultGPU is set to true, discrete if key not present or its set to false)\n    - Categories have been slimmed down - less apps should default to the “Other” category -When searching, Nemo bookmarks are also displayed in the search results\n- Shuffler Control animation when switching tabs is now the same as budgie-desktop-settings & the app-menu so that we have a consistent look and feel\n- SDXC card and such like now appears in DropBy … so the popup prompt will appear when such a card is inserted in the same way as a USB drive & stick\n- Hotcorners now has an option to “delay” the activation of a hotcorner as well as invoking via “pressure” - i.e. how quickly you pushed your cursor into the corner. This will be useful for those touchpads that doesn’t have the sensitivity to allow for the extant pressure option.\n- Budgie Previews, Budgie Quickchar and Budgie Window Shuffler now appear in GNOME-Software with meaningful descriptions and pictures.\n- Quicknote pop-up correctly retains its scroll-position so no need to keep scrolling up and down to find text you previously was looking at.\n- Fix crash with shuffler when an application window disappears when using invoking shuffler actions.\n- Quickchar gets a nice new app icon to view in the menu.\n- Applications menu category view now defaults to 6px which gives a less squashed look for most themes - this can be configured via the applet settings.\n- Budgie Trash Applet has a number of fixes and enhancements:\n    - Support multiple file drag and drop to panel icon.\n    - Show trash full icon when there are items in trash.\n    - Open trash folder instead of popup when > 100 items.\n    - Fix paths with certain characters not restoring correctly.\n\n### Budgie Desktop\n\n\\[caption id=\"attachment\\_2702\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"744\"\\]![This image shows Budgie Control Center](images/mg-jammy-releasenotes-03-744x710.jpg) Budgie Control Center\\[/caption\\]\n\n- Our default layout has changed slightly. The icons in the panel now have additional spacing to ensure we no longer have a cramped look-and-feel. The appindicator applet is now at the beginning of the right ride block of icons. To see this if you are upgrading you will need to reset your panel: `nohup budgie-panel --reset --replace &`\n    \n- RISCV64 support has now been enabled for this up-and-coming architecture [https://discourse.ubuntubudgie.org/t/testing-22-04-are-you-brave-enough/5461/56](https://discourse.ubuntubudgie.org/t/testing-22-04-are-you-brave-enough/5461/56)\n    \n- Our plank-preferences menu option no longer appears in GNOME Software - this will ensure users of other desktop don’t accidentally install this together with budgie!\n    \n- Budgie Desktop 10.6 has been released - [https://github.com/BuddiesOfBudgie/budgie-desktop/releases/tag/v10.6](https://github.com/BuddiesOfBudgie/budgie-desktop/releases/tag/v10.6)\n    \n- GNOME Control Center AKA Settings has now been hidden from the menu. New from budgie 10.6 is our Budgie Control Center (via the menu) to control all budgie relevant control & device settings.\n    \n\n### Raspberry PI\n\nThe 22.04 Pi4 beta image is now available. This includes all the updates from the desktop image described in the release already including the firefox snap and theming changes. For the beta we have hidden the VNC option in the Pi app since GNOME have removed that capability in GNOME 42. We will be investigating the way-forward. In the interim we recommend the GNOME 42 RDP option available through the Pi App\n\n### Themes and Wallpapers\n\n\\[caption id=\"attachment\\_2701\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"744\"\\]![This image shows Ubuntu Budgie wallpapers selection.](images/mg-jammy-releasenotes-02-744x703.jpg) Ubuntu Budgie 22.04 Wallpapers\\[/caption\\]\n\n- 22.04 wallpapers are available on daily iso. If you want to learn more about our wallpaper contest, [check our blog post](https://ubuntubudgie.org/2022/02/ubuntu-budgie-22-04-wallpaper-contest/ \"check our blog post\").\n- GTK+4 compatible version of Arc Theme available in Makeovers.\n- Latest version of WhiteSur icon theme available in Makeovers - backported to 20.04/21.10.\n- Latest version of WhiteSur GTK theme available in Makeovers - backported to 20.04/21.10.\n- Pocillo Gtk Theme has the following fixes\n- Displays correctly the keyboard indicator applet for the dark-theme when CAPS/NUM lock is active.\n- QogirBudgie Gtk Theme has been refreshed from upstream\n- Pocillo icon theme has been refreshed from upstream tela-icon and qogir icon sources.\n\n### Budgie Welcome\n\n\\[caption id=\"attachment\\_2705\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"744\"\\]![This image shows ubuntu budgie welcome application](images/mg-jammy-releasenotes-05-744x415.jpg) Budgie welcome application\\[/caption\\]\n\n- Lots of updated translations from our brilliant translators: Transifex [https://www.transifex.com/ubuntu-budgie/](https://www.transifex.com/ubuntu-budgie/).\n- Welcome snap updated to install 22.04 budgie-extras etc.\n- Welcome snap includes a snapshot of the community developed gaming page. Please do get involved to shape this Community project: Ubuntu Budgie Gaming [https://discourse.ubuntubudgie.org/t/community-project-ubuntu-budgie-gaming/5225](https://discourse.ubuntubudgie.org/t/community-project-ubuntu-budgie-gaming/5225).\n- MS Edge web-browser now available to be installed in the browser ballot (Getting Started).\n- In the Getting Started - ballot browser - the Brave deb repository is an install option alongside the snap install.\n- For 22.04 there is a new Chrome OS like layout available via budgie welcome.\n- For 22.04 the deb version of Firefox has been removed since only the snap is now available.\n- Canonical’s Firefox ESR (extended support release) PPA is now a browser option for all supported released.\n\n### Mesa\n\nLate breaking for 22.04 is the inclusion of mesa 22. If you don’t know what mesa is - it is the 3d graphic layer that translates graphics requests to your graphics driver. A few important points about this change:\n\n- This is really great news for Gamers - the latest vulkan stuff comes automatically so the latest and greatest games now and in the future have a great base to work from 22.04.\n\n### Additional\n\n- Catfish is no more. We have now dropped this as part of the default install. There should no longer be a catfish rightclick option in the nemo file-manager. File name search & file content search is available via nemo itself.\n\n## Upgrading from previous releases\n\nIt is important to keep in mind a few useful tips before attempting a release upgrade:\n\n- Backup your data.\n- Install all available updates and reboot.\n- It is always a good idea to run either a full system snapshot with Timeshift, to a secondary drive, or a full system image using Clonezilla.\n- If you have PPAs that come with updated kernel, mesa, GPU drivers, it is better to purge those PPAs and reboot before attempting release upgrade.\n- Once release upgrade starts, all your PPAs will be disabled. If you rely on important software from PPAs, it is better to manually check if those are updated for upcoming release of Ubuntu.\n- After upgrade is completed, remember to go to software sources, change release name on your PPAs, enable them and refresh package cache.\n\n### Scheduled upgrade from 20.04 LTS\n\nUsers of Ubuntu Budgie 20.04 LTS will be prompted to upgrade to new 22.04 LTS version, but not right away.

More details on this below.\n\n## History\n\n- Budgie Remix had launched in April 2016\n- In Nov 2016 Ubuntu Budgie was granted the status as an official community flavour with Ubuntu/Canonical.\n- 17.04 was our first release official release as a flavour.\n- 18.04 was our first Long Term Support release\n- 20.04 is our second Long Term Support release\n- 22.04 is our third Long Term Support release\n\n## Goals\n\nAs we close off our fiscal year for 2022 (Apr 2021 – Mar 31, 2022), the financial position of the project is very healthy. We have met several goals this year and including our stretch goal:\n\n- LTS Fiscal Goal – ensure that the costs to support a three-year LTS were in place.\n- Stretch Goal – ensure we have reserves to meet five years of costs (2021 – 2025).\n- Increase transparency by joining Open Collective and finding a Fiscal Host.\n\n## Operating Costs\n\n- Infrastructure costs relating to the website, test build servers, domain registrations\n- Reserves are in place as a contingency to account for unexpected expenses.\n- Two IRCCloud monthly subscriptions\n\n## Purchases\n\nThis year the only purchases made were prizes for our [Ubuntu Budgie 22.04 Wallpaper Contest](https://ubuntubudgie.org/2022/02/ubuntu-budgie-22-04-wallpaper-contest/ \"Ubuntu Budgie 22.04 Wallpaper Contest\"). Details of the contest and its prizes are shared on our [discourse post](http:/https://discourse.ubuntubudgie.org/t/ubuntu-budgie-22-04-wallpaper-contest/5501/ \"discourse post\").\n\n## Donations\n\n### Open Collective\n\nAs of May 2022, Ubuntu Budgie joined Open Collective. This is something the team wanted to do for a while, in order to provide great transparency over our financial status, donations, and expenses. Anyone is now able to check up to date status of the project, how many donations are coming in, what expenses are being approved. This also reduces workload on our team, as all financial calculations are done automatically, and reviewed by our awesome fiscal host.\n\nYou can check our Collective here: [Ubuntu Budgie Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/ubuntubudgie \"Ubuntu Budgie Open Collective\") Special thanks to our awesome fiscal host, Accountable. This service is provided by [The Social Change Nest](https://opencollective.com/the-social-change-nest \"The Social Change Nest\")\n\nAs we are going to focus on Open Collective, we would like to ask our community to use it for donations. This helps with transparency, reduces workload on our team, and greatly reduces our costs. Patreon and Paypal are going to stay active, however donating directly via Open Collective ensures your donations are more effective, as there are less transaction fees.\n\n### Patreon\n\nFor 2021-2022 we did have a handful of Patreon donors. Open Collective is now a great way to give Ubuntu Budgie a regular income. If you do not want to contribute via Open Collective, please do consider becoming a Patreon.\n\n### PayPal\n\nWe have had many individuals who donate via Paypal, and we thank you all! Open Collective is now a wonderful way to give one off donations and also regular tips. We realise PayPal is a preferred way for many people to use - so we do love to receive PayPal tips if Open Collective is not for you.\n\n## Sponsorship\n\n### Digital Ocean\n\nDigitalOcean has been an incredible sponsor of our project throughout the years, paying for all of our 2017-2021 hosting and infrastructure fees. We are grateful and excited to have DigitalOcean as a sponsor. [https://www.digitalocean.com](https://www.digitalocean.com)\n\n### Discourse\n\nOur community support is via a hosted discourse forum which was generously provided through sponsorship as well. [https://www.discourse.org/](https://www.discourse.org/)\n\n## Future Goals\n\n- Now that we are on Open Collective, we are working to get our team members onboard. This will make expenses claim easier, faster, and completely transparent.\n- We are planning to revamp our merch store and bring more extiting items.\n\n## Contributions\n\nOur confidence level for our financial viability is as close to 100% as you can get.\n\n- This year our community has contributed approx £2372 with set-aside costs for 2021 to 2025 + reserves.\n- We have a nominal £10613 in the bank, which can be checked on our Ubuntu Budgie Open Collective page.\n\n### Previous years contributions overview:\n\n2016-2017, our community contributed £248.90 with no set-aside costs and no reserves 2017-2018, our community contributed £2460 with set-aside costs for 2018 to 2022 + reserves 2018-2019, our community contributed £2919 with set-aside costs for 2019 to 2023 + reserves 2019-2020, our community contributed £3258 with set-aside costs for 2020 to 2024 + reserves 2020-2019, our community contributed £5507 with set-aside costs for 2021 to 2025 + reserves\n\nWith your help, we look forward to making more donations to developers and organisations who have helped Ubuntu Budgie.\n\n## The Team\n\nAll Ubuntu Budgie team members are volunteers. At this point we the team do not benefit financially in anyway from your generosity. If we had one or more full-time developers, then the speed of development and improvement would be exponentially higher. For this to become fiscally possible, the project would need to grow to approx 10x the current contribution rate to achieve that.\n\n## Canonical Support\n\nAlthough we are an official flavour of the Ubuntu Family, we do not receive any financial help from Canonical. Canonical supports Ubuntu Budgie through their launchpad build systems and ISO distribution costs.\n\n## Donations\n\nIf you would like to support Ubuntu Budgie, please feel free to donate to the project through Open Collective. Paypal or Patreon will remain open but please be aware there are higher transaction fees, as all donations are transferred to our Open Collective.\n\n## Thank You\n\nAll donors are displayed on our website unless you specifically request not to be presented. Thank you to all who have chosen to join our community.\n\nDavid (project lead)","src/content/blog/2022/06/ubuntu-budgie-annual-financial-statement-2021-2022.md","987d4597e6c8b528",{"html":3177,"metadata":3178},"\u003Ch2 id=\"summary\">Summary\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>As part of our commitment to be transparent with the community, the team is pleased to present a short statement of our financial position covering 2021 to 2022.

This takes the 20.10/21.04 and 21.10 release notes and highlights the key parts that 20.04 upgraders need to be aware of.\n\nIf you are upgrading from 21.10 we have a [release note](https://ubuntubudgie.org/2022/03/ubuntu-budgie-22-04-lts-release-notes/ \"release note\") more applicable to you!\n\nIn these release notes the areas covered are:\n\n- New features and enhancements\n- Upgrading from 20.04 Ubuntu Budgie\n- Fixed Issues\n- Known Issues when upgrading\n- Where to download Ubuntu Budgie\n\n## New features and enhancements\n\n![This image shows Budgie Control Center](images/mg-jammy-releasenotes-03-744x710.jpg) Budgie Control Center\n\n### Translations\n\n- Translations Thanks to our incredible community members that have stepped up to translate Budgie, Budgie is now more accessible than ever. Budgie introduces support for three new languages: Afrikaans, Albanian, and Hindi. Budgie now has 40 languages which have 90% or more coverage and we have seen dedicated translators step up for a wide range of languages, many of which are now completely translated.\n- We are still working hard to get Budgie translated 100% into many languages. If you are interested in helping translate Budgie into your language, feel free to reach out! [https://www.transifex.com/ubuntu-budgie/](https://www.transifex.com/ubuntu-budgie/)\n\n### 22.04 Areas to look out for\n\n- Mesa. Late breaking for 22.04 is the inclusion of mesa 22. This is really great news for Gamers – the latest vulkan stuff comes automatically so the latest and greatest games now and in the future have a great base to work from 22.04.\n- Catfish is no more. We have now dropped this as part of the default install. There should no longer be a catfish rightclick option in the nemo file-manager. File name search & file content search is available via nemo itself.\n- All packages are now arm64 available - see the raspberry Pi section below.\n- gedit text edit highlight for current line turned off. Dark themes are broken with gedit and often the text color cannot be read.\n- New option \"Align to grid\" when right click the desktop – this switches on the desktop grid mode. Note there will now be a \"Customise\" right click menu option available when you choose Align to grid and this can be used to customise the grid including turning off/on the icon auto-arrangement\n- We now ship with our own file extension handling list of apps e.g. picture files should open in the viewer gthumb and .deb should open in gnome-software\n- We now disable the nemo behaviour where a double-click in an empty area would go up one folder\n- We enable default in nemo to allow a slow doubleclick on filename to rename a file\n- Nemo – Enforce asking when deleting and moving to trash so that inadvertent deleting files is not possible\n- Both nemo-share and nemo-dropbox backport packages have been rebuilt from the upstream v4.6.0 package\n- For new accounts/new installs, gnome-software no longer autostarts. This reduces the memory desktop usage by approx 100-150Mb. You’ll see an autostart entry in your autostart list – don't worry, this is just to stop the autostart running for budgie-desktop – but runs correctly for GNOME Shell/Unity desktops.\n- Often requested, htop has now been added as a default install –> this may be removed again if we can’t hide from the menu\n- We have run a poll with the community and the community have clearly spoken: thunderbird is now the default email client. Geary has been dropped from the ISO.\n- The backup tool deja-dup has become a great tool for backups and restores and we are more than happy to include this on our ISO out of the box.\n- Out of the box we now include thousands of printer drivers including support for Epson and Canon printers via printer-driver-gutenprint\n- We now include sane-airscan which supports thousands of modern network scanners (and a few USB based as well). Use simple-scan to connect to your scanner.\n- Budgie Arm & Pi – this tiny app will appear in your menu which ties our Raspberry Pi efforts with the main distro – more information here [https://ubuntubudgie.org/2021/03/release-notes-ubuntu-budgie-21-04-on-a-raspberry-pi-4/](https://ubuntubudgie.org/2021/03/release-notes-ubuntu-budgie-21-04-on-a-raspberry-pi-4/)\n- Slick Greeter now has the ability to configure the format of the clock – use Login Window to-do this.\n- Whilst Moka icons is no longer part of our defaults, we continue to look after the package on behalf of Debian and Ubuntu. Lots of proposed pull-requests have been included in our soft-fork to continue making Moka a first class icon set for all users.\n- Settings (aka GNOME Settings) has now been replaced by Budgie Control Center (BCC)\n- In BCC – there is now a \"Power Mode\" section. The performance profile will only be available on systems which provide this functionality.\n- Some GNOME \"42\" applications are now in the repository. If they have been compiled with GTK-4 they will be Adwaita themed. This is to be expected since the vast majority of GTK themes only support GTK-3 and GTK-2 at this point in time. Please let us know which apps are Adwaita themed so we can monitor in future how these apps behave in newer themes made available as part of the 22.10 development cycle.\n- A couple of fixes to budgie-desktop-environment has been made to make budgie more friendly to other desktop environments / remote access that use dash as the default shell.\n- Nemo Previews now available as a recommended app in Budgie Welcome to allow you to visualise the content of a highlighted file. Just press Space to toggle the viewer in Nemo. Backported to 20.04 & 20.10 as well.\n- IRC links in Budgie Welcome now point to Libera Chat since the Ubuntu family has ended its association with Freenode.\n- Right click on a picture via Nemo has a “Set as wallpaper” menu option. This now has a fix to set both the desktop wallpaper and the lock-screen wallpaper at the same time. Previously only the desktop wallpaper was updated.\n- From 22.04 Canonical & Mozilla will be enforcing all flavours to swap to using the snap version of Firefox.\n\n### Raspberry PI\n\n![This image shows Budgie ARM Tweak Tool](images/mg-budgie-arm-tweaktool.png) Budgie ARM Tweak Tool\n\nThe 22.04 Pi4 image is now available. This includes all the updates from the desktop image described in the release already including the firefox snap and theming changes. For this release the optional VNC option in the Pi app autostarts on boot up. This means the PI image can run headless.\n\n- Added support for the Compute Module 4 board\n- Add --force-arm-mode command line option\n- Add --force-findpi-mode command line option\n- Add --force-model modelname command line option\n- Add --model modelname —cpuinfo “CPU String to Match”\n- Disable buttons and provide hint on Display tab if pibootctl is not found\n- Disable buttons and provide hint on Overclock tab if no ‘/boot/firmware/config.txt’\n- Enhanced the various option discoverability by using mouse hover and displaying a hint in a ‘status area’\n\n### Budgie desktop\n\n![This image shows Ubuntu Budgie 22.04 desktop](images/mg-jammy-releasenotes-01-744x415.jpg) Ubuntu Budgie 22.04 Desktop\n\n- Our default layout has changed slightly. The icons in the panel now have additional spacing to ensure we no longer have a cramped look-and-feel. The appindicator applet is now at the beginning of the right ride block of icons. To see this if you are upgrading you will need to reset your panel: nohup budgie-panel --reset --replace &\n- RISCV64 support has now been enabled for this up-and-coming architecture [https://discourse.ubuntubudgie.org/t/testing-22-04-are-you-brave-enough/5461/56](https://discourse.ubuntubudgie.org/t/testing-22-04-are-you-brave-enough/5461/56)\n- Our plank-preferences menu option no longer appears in GNOME Software – this will ensure users of other desktop don’t accidentally install this together with budgie!\n- Budgie Desktop 10.6.1 has been released – [https://github.com/BuddiesOfBudgie/budgie-desktop/releases/tag/v10.6](https://github.com/BuddiesOfBudgie/budgie-desktop/releases/tag/v10.6)\n- GNOME Control Center AKA Settings has now been hidden from the menu. New from budgie 10.6 is Budgie Control Center (via the menu) to control all budgie relevant control & device settings.\n- You can now choose which screenshot app to be invoked when pressing Print, Ctrl Print, Alt Print – dconf-editor is used to change the app\n- Being a good contributor – we have upstream'd to the budgie-desktop project several 20.04 patches we have developed (Wnck crash, gnome-shell/budgie-desktop conflict as well as the ability to define the print button screenshot app)\n- Fix created and pull-request made to allow non Latin keyboard layouts from the keyboard applet\n- Wallpaper changing now respects the animation flag – so if you turn of animations, changing wallpapers occur instantaneously\n- Fix occasional crash when removing applets from a panel\n- Upstream has resolved system tray icons breaking on login, resume from suspension\n- Upstream: chromium browser based notifications now display their icons\n- Upstream has enabled creating new instances of windows via middle click of icon task list applet\n- Upstream has completely reworked the system tray. This resolves lots of issues including icons appearing to overlap each other.\n- In raven we display week-numbers by default for the calendar\n- \"Default\" theme in budgie-desktop-settings is now hidden\n- Budgie Menu introduces additional checks for an application's DesktopAppInfo, ensuring that budgie consistently skip apps and exclude them from calculations when they have Hidden or NoDisplay set, as well as if the NotShowIn contains Budgie.\n- Budgie Menu will no longer show empty categories, a common occurrence when installing applications via WINE.\n- Budgie Menu will now alphabetically sort category names, which is useful when you have custom user desktop directories for applications. They are no longer forced to be below default system-wide desktop directories such as Internet / Networking, Office, Sound & Video, etc.\n- Applications which utilize pkexec in their desktop info will now spawn an asynchronous process, with pkexec being the command and passing the rest of the command line content as arguments.\n- The Icon Tasklist applet has seen new features and behaviour refinements\n- There are now two new options available, disabled by default, to launch a new instance of an application via the respective button for the application: middle click and double click. This expands on the existing option to create a new instance of an application by clicking the + button in the popover of each Icon Button.\n- The behavior of the Icon Tasklist has been refined - more consistent rejection of various types of windows, such as docks, apps with splashscreens and utilities e.g. controls for an emulator.\n- Resolved an issue where the pin and new instance buttons were being unintentionally shown, as well as an issue where you could not close Budgie Desktop Settings via the IconPopover controls (right click popover for each Icon Button in the tasklist).\n    \n    - When the “Show All Windows on Click” option is enabled, budgie will now more consistently show or minimize all windows on click if one of them is currently active.\n    - If only one instance of an application is open and it is on another workspace (in this case the “Restrict to Workspace” option is not enabled), budgie switches to that workspace and unminimize the window (since the chances are you probably want to see the application in the first place).\n- The Sound applet has seen a redesign and now features a dedicated button for mute toggling, as well as leveraging iconography for the System.\n- Dating back to the days of Budgie 7 in 2014, Budgie had been using an na-tray implementation also seen in desktop environments such as Cinnamon for the creation and management of system tray icons. Thanks to the incredible work by Solus contributor Campbell Jones, the System Tray has been completely rewritten from scratch, supporting tray icons leveraging the XEmbed Protocol. This new implementation resolves numerous issues such as:\n- Background icons not refreshing, resulting in instances where it may appear that multiple icons are overlapping.\n- Tray icons not consistently hiding when a panel hides (during “Intelligent” mode).\n- Tray icons blinking when panel transparency is set to “Dynamic”\n- Tray icons getting hidden when switching icon themes.\n- Additionally, a configuration option has been added for the System Tray that enables the setting of spacing between individual icons, making it perfect for those that want both their applets and tray icons to be equidistant!\n- For those which use Budgie in another language than English, the menu items presented when adding a new Autostart application or command via the Autostart section are now translatable. For any language which has the terms translated, those will be used instead.\n- Raven introduces a new option to choose which side of the screen Raven should be. Previously Raven would always appear on the left side when the main panel and trigger were on the left, and appear on the right when the main panel was anywhere else.\n- Users will be able to choose between this behaviour, called “Automatic”, as well as left and right sides!\n- Here are some other aspects of Budgie that received refinements:\n- Animation disabling: Background transitions and workspace switching are no longer always enabled but now honor the option to disable animations in Budgie Desktop Settings\n- Budgie’s Application Switcher a. Typically referred to as the Alt+Tab switcher, this switcher now supports the Ctrl modifier, adding support for more custom keyboard layouts and mappings. b.support an option to show all windows from all workspaces in the switcher, enabling you to switch between applications and workspaces simultaneously. c. Budgie Run Dialog can now check keywords, improving search and aligning its behaviour closer to that of Budgie Menu.\n- Caffeine Applet: When Caffeine Mode is enabled, the timer will now update the spin button value based on how many minutes are remaining.\n- Forward-specific keyboard layout switching can now be done with Alt+Shift.\n- Transparency is now supported in background images, falling back to the fixed color or gradient behind it.\n- The Tasklist applet will no longer cause the rest of the panel contents to be thrown into the aether when you have many windows open. You will be able to scroll up / down to get all the windows. In the future budgie will be working on creating dedicated buttons in the tasklist applet.\n- Regions which do not have any panel widgets / applets will no longer be shown, allowing applets to take up more space and eliminates weird spacing related issues.\n- Chromium-based browser notifications no longer display with broken icon images. This was due to the fact that these browsers would prefix the icon with file:/// and Chromium-based browsers would not pass the correct path. We will now default to the fallback mail-unread-symbolic icon for these applications.\n- Notifications and Notification Groups can no longer be selected, which would result in a visual change with no obvious or easy way to deselect them. There are no functional changes, as there are no actions which make use of the selection of Notifications or Notification Groups.\n- Notifications are no longer appended to Notification Groups, resulting in older Notifications being higher in a Notification Group’s list than newer ones.\n- The Sound widget will no longer allow raising the volume above 100% when the option is off.\n- Budgie Popovers will now properly handle window scale factors.\n- Crash fixes related to the usage of Wnck have been resolved.\n- Fix some custom keyboard shortcuts and media keys not correctly applying after boot or reboot.\n- Night Light will now appropriately start or end if an application has the fullscreen state amongst its many states, and not just beThemes and Layouts now show a tab-look interface – this should aid discovery of layouts since it appears people couldn’t instantly visualise that option\n- For this release, Ubuntu Budgie also has a fix added for non-english keyboard layouts such as Japanese/Chinese/Korean etc. We have added a bug-fix into budgie-desktop so that Ibus suggestions are displayed.\n- Fix application icons not scaling in Raven’s Notification Group headers.\n- Fix issue with VirtualBox icon not being displayed in IconTaskList applet\n- Fix regression in Budgie Desktop Settings icon handling.\n- MPRIS metadata, playback status, and CanGoPrevious / CanGoNext fetching is now performed immediately rather than being an unnecessary idle operation.\n- Notifications now use a high priority timeout.\n- Notification iconography now uses a consistent IconSize.DIALOG instead of IconSize.INVALID and only scales if the icon provided is not already the desired height.\n- Prevent Budgie Desktop Settings from being pinned via drag-and-drop, fixing an issue where Budgie Desktop Settings was inadvertently pinnable and unable to be unpinned.\n- Sound Indicator applet and Raven\n- Use standard mute/unmute methods, fixing issues like muting with media keys and then trying to unmute via the applet, which would previously not work.\n- System Tray applet\n- Fix issue with KeePass causing panel segfaults.\n- Various stability improvements, such as more proactive X11 error trapping.\n- In GNOME Shell and GNOME Settings Daemon 40, there were changes introduced which impacted Budgie’s ability to use dedicated screensavers, such as gnome-screensaver (which we have been using since 2017). As always, we encourage that Budgie be used with lightdm and an optional greeter such as slick-greeter, as opposed to being installed alongside GDM and GNOME Shell where locking the screen is very hit-and-miss.\n- Here are some quality-of-life improvements shipping in Budgie\n- Filter out audacious notifications so they do not clutter up Raven.\n- Spacing is now configurable in the Status applet.\n- The application fullscreen state tracking has been slightly rewritten to use the window XIDs, only call our track window state function on specific flags in the changed or current state, and reducing instances where some unset flags would not result in the application being removed as a fullscreen application.\n- There is now an option in Budgie and exposed via Budgie Desktop Settings’ “Windows” section to automatically pause notifications when a window is fullscreen and unpause when there no longer is a fullscreen window. This is useful in reducing distractions when gaming or watching content!\n- We will no longer filter device added / removed notifications. This resolves issues where ejection notifications for external media would not get stored in Raven’s Notifications section.\n- When xdotool is available on the operating system, the Lock Keys applet can be clicked to toggle CapsLock and NumLock!\n\n## Budgie applets & Budgie mini-apps\n\n![Mg Budgie Welcome 20](images/mg-budgie-welcome-20-744x745.jpg) Budgie Extras\n\n- Latest version of budgie-calendar-applet\n- Budgie-indicator-applet has now swapped to support ayatana-indicators. This is the new upstream of the original ubuntu indicators.\n- ayatana-indicator-applet can be installed – this integrates with Evolution & Thunderbird (with the evolution plugin) to display appointments and calendar events\n- ayatana-webmail can be installed – this displays notifications in plank when an email is received.\n- budgie-applications-menu-applet: This has the following enhancements from upstream.\n    - App context menu available when right click from search results\n    - Reads the PrefersNonDefaultGPU setting from .desktop files and uses that to automatically configure default or non-default GPU\n    - Adds a new context menu to support choosing the other GPU (integrated if PrefersNonDefaultGPU is set to true, discrete if key not present or its set to false)\n    - Categories have been slimmed down – less apps should default to the “Other” category -When searching, Nemo bookmarks are also displayed in the search results\n- Shuffler Control animation when switching tabs is now the same as budgie-desktop-settings & the app-menu so that we have a consistent look and feel\n- SDXC card and such like now appears in DropBy … so the popup prompt will appear when such a card is inserted in the same way as a USB drive & stick\n- Hotcorners now has an option to “delay” the activation of a hotcorner as well as invoking via “pressure” – i.e. how quickly you pushed your cursor into the corner. This will be useful for those touchpads that doesn’t have the sensitivity to allow for the extant pressure option.\n- Quicknote pop-up correctly retains its scroll-position so no need to keep scrolling up and down to find text you previously was looking at.\n- Fix crash with shuffler when an application window disappears when using invoking shuffler actions.\n- Quickchar gets a nice new app icon to view in the menu.\n- Applications menu category view now defaults to 6px which gives a less squashed look for most themes – this can be configured via the applet settings.\n- Budgie Trash Applet has a number of fixes and enhancements:\n    - Support multiple file drag and drop to panel icon.\n    - Show trash full icon when there are items in trash.\n    - Open trash folder instead of popup when > 100 items.\n    - Fix paths with certain characters not restoring correctly.\n- Hotcorners: Option added to configure hotcorners via budgie-desktop-settings and therefore hide the icon from the panel\n- Dropby: Applet settings now has the ability to display the USB window notification in any corner you define\n- Dropby: Animation when copying media so that you now when copying is in progress/finished\n- Application Menu: Touch Screen friendly – can now swipe on your touchscreen\n- Application Menu: Better keyboard navigation from the search to categories etc.\n- Application Menu: Search bar changes position to the bottom when on a bottom panel\n- Application Menu: Hide the large number of Settings menu icons shown in the grid view and the System Tools category menu – its more elegant this way – use the search capabilities to find Settings options like bluetooth and sharing etc.\n- Application Menu: In a similar fashion the logout/restart/suspend/shutdown icons have now been removed. Search actions are now available for these + the ability to \"lock\" the screen when searching and \"hibernate\" if you have enabled hibernation separately\n- Application Menu: Mouse rollover capability in the category view is now available via applet settings\n- Application Menu: Handling of fractions should be better and more intuitive (e.g. 5.3\\*0.5 in the search bar)\n- Application Menu – Category view – styled as a sidebar now\n- Previews: enable/disabling the capability is now dynamic – there is no need to logout/login\n- Previews: now displays a tooltip on mouse hover (configurable) to show the full window name\n- Window Shuffler – enable/disabling the capability is now dynamic – there is no need to logout/login\n- Window Shuffler Sticky Neighbours – nWindow Shuffler – Window Rules: Add ability to set the position and size together with the monitor location to open an application on\n- Window Shuffler – Layouts: Add the ability to launch and group together multiple applications\n- Window Shuffler – Window Rules: Add ability to set the position and size together with the monitor location to open an application on\n- Window Shuffler – Layouts: Add the ability to launch and group together multiple applications\n- Applications Menu:\n    - Cosmetic – labels on budgie-desktop-settings are left aligned.\n    - from upstream Terminal apps are no-longer shown in the menu such as xterm\n    - QuickChar installation is now easier on other on Debian based distro’s – should not now need to patch your install locations\n- A new independent applet called budgie-clipboard-applet is now available – -look out for it via Menu – Budgie Extras\n- A new independent applet called budgie-analogue-applet ([https://github.com/samlane-ma/budgie-analog-clock](https://github.com/samlane-ma/budgie-analog-clock)) is now available\n- Bug fix for the applications menu so that rollover menus settings is remembered on logon.\n- The number of cities that our weather applet can now search has increased from 22.6k to 185k\n- Change to budgie-pixel-saver-applet. It now handles blacklisting of apps to stop it trying to add window decorations where a window didn’t have one in the first place. e.g. Firefox, Telegram and Ulauncher.\n- Fix for spamming the syslog when previews was enabled but end-user was logged into a wayland desktop session\n- Fix for WIndow Shuffler layouts executable installation path to work on stateless distros\n- Window Shuffler Control has been completely revamped and redesigned\n- Shuffler Control\n- Window Shuffler now includes an applet to (re-) arrange and automatically move windows, either a single window or a group of windows.\n- Shuffler now includes Window Rules – explained here [https://discourse.ubuntubudgie.org/t/testing-21-10-are-you-brave-enough/4897/4?u=fossfreedom](https://discourse.ubuntubudgie.org/t/testing-21-10-are-you-brave-enough/4897/4?u=fossfreedom)\n- Shuffler Window rules now allow you to open application windows on specific workspaces\n- Applications Menu – Calculator now shows a visual hint how to copy the result to the clipboard.

If you rely on important software from PPAs, it is better to manually check if those are updated for upcoming release of Ubuntu.\n- After upgrade is completed, remember to go to software sources, change release name on your PPAs, enable them and refresh package cache\n\n### How to upgrade from 20.04\n\nFor those that don’t want to wait, it is possible to trigger manual upgrade by hand. If you are interested, follow the procedure below. If you want to learn more, you can check latest and up to date [22.04 upgrade procedure on Ubuntu Wiki](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/JammyUpgrades \" 22.04 upgrade procedure on Ubuntu Wiki\").\n\n- Run the update-manager application;\n- In Update Manager, click the Settings... button, and enter your password to start the Software Sources application.\n- Select the sub menu Updates from the Software Sources application.\n- Confirm the \"Notify me of a new Ubuntu version:\" option is set to \"For any new version\" if you are using 21.10 or to \"For long-term support versions\" if you are using 20.04 LTS. If it is not set properly modify it to the appropriate option.\n- Close the Software Sources application and return to Update Manager.\n- In Update Manager, click the Check button to check for new updates.\n- If there are any updates to install, use the Install Updates button to install them, then exit.\n- In a terminal run update-manager -c -d.\n- A message will appear informing you of the availability of the new release.\n- Click Upgrade.\n- Follow the on-screen instructions.\n\n## Download\n\n![This image shows Ubuntu Budgie website](images/mg-jammy-releasenotes-06-744x302.jpg) ubuntubudgie.org\n\nLinks to download final releases, as well as installation instructions, are available on our Ubuntu Budgie website: [https://ubuntubudgie.org/downloads/](https://ubuntubudgie.org/downloads/).\n\n## Getting support\n\nThanks to the generosity of discourse.org, our support site is the crucial site for all things Ubuntu Budgie.\n\nOne to bookmark [https://discourse.ubuntubudgie.org](https://discourse.ubuntubudgie.org) More information can be found here.\n\n## Infrastructure sponsors\n\nWe just wanted to thank our infrastructure sponsors who help us keep the lights on.\n\n### Digital Ocean\n\nOn a mission to simplify cloud computing so developers and their teams can spend more time building software that changes the world.\n\n### Discourse\n\nDiscourse is the 100% open source discussion platform built for the next decade of the Internet.

Late breaking for 22.04 is the inclusion of mesa 22. This is really great news for Gamers – the latest vulkan stuff comes automatically so the latest and greatest games now and in the future have a great base to work from 22.04.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Catfish is no more. We have now dropped this as part of the default install. There should no longer be a catfish rightclick option in the nemo file-manager. File name search &#x26; file content search is available via nemo itself.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>All packages are now arm64 available - see the raspberry Pi section below.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>gedit text edit highlight for current line turned off. Dark themes are broken with gedit and often the text color cannot be read.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>New option “Align to grid” when right click the desktop – this switches on the desktop grid mode. Note there will now be a “Customise” right click menu option available when you choose Align to grid and this can be used to customise the grid including turning off/on the icon auto-arrangement\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>We now ship with our own file extension handling list of apps e.g. picture files should open in the viewer gthumb and .deb should open in gnome-software\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>We now disable the nemo behaviour where a double-click in an empty area would go up one folder\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>We enable default in nemo to allow a slow doubleclick on filename to rename a file\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Nemo – Enforce asking when deleting and moving to trash so that inadvertent deleting files is not possible\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Both nemo-share and nemo-dropbox backport packages have been rebuilt from the upstream v4.6.0 package\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>For new accounts/new installs, gnome-software no longer autostarts. This reduces the memory desktop usage by approx 100-150Mb. You’ll see an autostart entry in your autostart list – don’t worry, this is just to stop the autostart running for budgie-desktop – but runs correctly for GNOME Shell/Unity desktops.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Often requested, htop has now been added as a default install –> this may be removed again if we can’t hide from the menu\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>We have run a poll with the community and the community have clearly spoken: thunderbird is now the default email client. Geary has been dropped from the ISO.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>The backup tool deja-dup has become a great tool for backups and restores and we are more than happy to include this on our ISO out of the box.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Out of the box we now include thousands of printer drivers including support for Epson and Canon printers via printer-driver-gutenprint\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>We now include sane-airscan which supports thousands of modern network scanners (and a few USB based as well). Use simple-scan to connect to your scanner.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Budgie Arm &#x26; Pi – this tiny app will appear in your menu which ties our Raspberry Pi efforts with the main distro – more information here \u003Ca href=\"https://ubuntubudgie.org/2021/03/release-notes-ubuntu-budgie-21-04-on-a-raspberry-pi-4/\">https://ubuntubudgie.org/2021/03/release-notes-ubuntu-budgie-21-04-on-a-raspberry-pi-4/\u003C/a>\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Slick Greeter now has the ability to configure the format of the clock – use Login Window to-do this.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Whilst Moka icons is no longer part of our defaults, we continue to look after the package on behalf of Debian and Ubuntu. Lots of proposed pull-requests have been included in our soft-fork to continue making Moka a first class icon set for all users.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Settings (aka GNOME Settings) has now been replaced by Budgie Control Center (BCC)\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>In BCC – there is now a “Power Mode” section. The performance profile will only be available on systems which provide this functionality.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Some GNOME “42” applications are now in the repository. If they have been compiled with GTK-4 they will be Adwaita themed. This is to be expected since the vast majority of GTK themes only support GTK-3 and GTK-2 at this point in time. Please let us know which apps are Adwaita themed so we can monitor in future how these apps behave in newer themes made available as part of the 22.10 development cycle.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>A couple of fixes to budgie-desktop-environment has been made to make budgie more friendly to other desktop environments / remote access that use dash as the default shell.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Nemo Previews now available as a recommended app in Budgie Welcome to allow you to visualise the content of a highlighted file. Just press Space to toggle the viewer in Nemo. Backported to 20.04 &#x26; 20.10 as well.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>IRC links in Budgie Welcome now point to Libera Chat since the Ubuntu family has ended its association with Freenode.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Right click on a picture via Nemo has a “Set as wallpaper” menu option. This now has a fix to set both the desktop wallpaper and the lock-screen wallpaper at the same time. Previously only the desktop wallpaper was updated.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>From 22.04 Canonical &#x26; Mozilla will be enforcing all flavours to swap to using the snap version of Firefox.\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ul>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"raspberry-pi\">Raspberry PI\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg __ASTRO_IMAGE_=\"{&#x22;src&#x22;:&#x22;images/mg-budgie-arm-tweaktool.png&#x22;,&#x22;alt&#x22;:&#x22;This image shows Budgie ARM Tweak Tool&#x22;,&#x22;index&#x22;:0}\"> Budgie ARM Tweak Tool\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The 22.04 Pi4 image is now available.

If stability is more important than having the latest and greatest version of the kernel, desktop environment, and applications then Ubuntu Budgie 22.04 LTS is perfect for you.\n\nIn these release notes, we are going to cover the following items:\n\n- Release schedule\n- New features and enhancements\n- Upgrade from 22.04 LTS\n- Where to download Ubuntu Budgie daily, beta and final releases\n- Infrastructure Sponsors\n\n## Release Schedule\n\nIf you want to learn more, please see Release planning and scheduling, shared by Canonical on this post [https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/kinetic-kudu-release-schedule/27263](https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/kinetic-kudu-release-schedule/27263)\n\n## New Features and Enhancements\n\n## Applets and mini-apps\n\n1. Lots of updated translations from our brilliant translators [https://www.transifex.com/ubuntu-budgie/](https://www.transifex.com/ubuntu-budgie/)\n2. bug-fix - wallstreet accepts custom folder with spaces\n3. Traditional layout now reflects the default 'v10.7' layout upstream - use budgie welcome to apply this layout (see below)\n\n## Budgie Desktop & Budgie Control Center\n\n1. New upstream budgie-menu (traditional layout) with places, control-center and settings access buttons ![file](images/image-1664392472085.png)\n2. Sharing capabilities in BCC have been revamped - screensharing can now be performed via both RDP & VNC\n3. Fractional scaling support has been enhanced - backported to 22.04\n4. Lots of wacom support updates made in BCC\n5. color profile support in BCC reworked and only supported if the monitor used itself supports color-profiles\n6. BCC Displays show the monitor refresh rate\n7. Applets can now be globally spaced rather than needing individual spacers ![file](images/image-1664392188931.png)\n8. Refinements to the workspace applet\n9. Clock applet no longer displays a link to a calendar application\n10. Complete reworking of the Budgie in-built theme\n11. Icon-tasklist applet no longer supports non-grouping of apps\n12. v10.6.4 budgie-desktop is the version that we ship with together with a whole host of extra goodies. Upstream has full details as to what 10.6.4 consists of: [https://blog.buddiesofbudgie.org/budgie-10-6-2-released/](https://blog.buddiesofbudgie.org/budgie-10-6-2-released/) [https://blog.buddiesofbudgie.org/budgie-10-6-3-released/](https://blog.buddiesofbudgie.org/budgie-10-6-3-released/) [https://blog.buddiesofbudgie.org/budgie-10-6-4-released/](https://blog.buddiesofbudgie.org/budgie-10-6-4-released/)\n13. In addition we have added a native screenshot capability - look for the icon in the menu - or just press print screen / alt print screen etc etc. ![file](images/image-1665774091522.png) ![file](images/image-1665774120897.png)\n14. We have added the ability to use the \"preferred style\" option in budgie-desktop-settings desktop so that you can set the dark-light style of those GNOME 42 & libhandy based apps. This latter capablity will evolve as upstream works through various issues in this area. ![file](images/image-1664392015234.png)\n15. IBUS handling has been revamped to resolve the wrong keyboard layout on logon. This needs careful testing especially for those that use multiple keyboard layouts.\n\n## Raspberry Pi\n\nBeta release [https://sourceforge.net/projects/budgie-remix/files/budgie-raspi-22.10/](https://sourceforge.net/projects/budgie-remix/files/budgie-raspi-22.10/)\n\nThis release has all the new and changed updates described in this release note.\n\n## Budgie Welcome\n\nOur welcome app is automatically updated for all 20.04, 22.04 & 22.10 users\n\n1. Lots of updated translations from our brilliant translators [https://www.transifex.com/ubuntu-budgie/](https://www.transifex.com/ubuntu-budgie/)\n2. Our Backports is now complete - testing of budgie-welcome recommendations/themes and applets/getting started is needed.\n3. Menu Option and welcome page changed from \"Budgie Themes & Layouts\" to \"Budgie Makeovers & Layouts\" to present a more accurate overview of the capability.\n\n## Themes\n\n1. Orchis Gtk Theme has been update to the latest upstream version. Note - upstream has changed its name convention for each variant & colour. So on an upgrade you have to manually change your theme name when you re-add the backports PPA\n2. Pocillo Gtk Theme has the following fixes: fixes for styling mate-system-monitor fixes for styling atril pdf reader fixes for styling mate-calculator\n\n## Additional\n\n1. Pulseaudio is no longer our default audiostack. Pipewire is now the default. The package `pulseaudio` can safely be purged.\n\n## Areas to look out for\n\n1. Our default applications have been revamped - This is described fully in this post [https://discourse.ubuntubudgie.org/t/default-applications-review-for-22-10-23-04-and-beyond/5883?u=fossfreedom](https://discourse.ubuntubudgie.org/t/default-applications-review-for-22-10-23-04-and-beyond/5883?u=fossfreedom) and outlined here:\n    \n    - GNOME-Calculator → Mate Calc\n    - GNOME-Calendar → drop from the install\n    - GNOME-Maps → drop from the install\n    - GNOME System Monitor → Mate System Monitor\n    - Evince → Atril\n    - File Roller aka GNOME Archive Manager → leave as is and monitor\n    - Deja-Dup backup tool → leave as is and monitor\n    - GNOME Screenshot → drop from the install\n    - GEdit text editor → undecided\n    - GNOME Font Viewer → font-manager\n    - Cheese → guvcview or webcamoid\n    - Celluloid → Parole\n    - gThumb → leave as is and monitor\n    - GNOME Log → leave as is and monitor\n    - GNOME Disks → leave as is and monitor\n    - Rhythmbox → Lollypop + Goodvibes + gpodder - open question\n    - GNOME Characters → leave as is\n    - Transmission → leave as is and monitor\n2. We now have webp image support out-of-the-box\n    \n\n## Upgrading from previous releases\n\nIt is important to keep in mind a few useful tips before attempting a release upgrade:\n\n- Backup your data.\n- Install all available updates and reboot.\n- It is always a good idea to run either a full system snapshot with Timeshift, to a secondary drive, or a full system image using Clonezilla.\n- If you have PPAs that come with updated kernel, mesa, GPU drivers, it is better to purge those PPAs and reboot before attempting release upgrade.\n- Once release upgrade starts, all your PPAs will be disabled. If you rely on important software from PPAs, it is better to manually check if those are updated for upcoming release of Ubuntu.\n- After upgrade is completed, remember to go to software sources, change release name on your PPAs, enable them and refresh package cache.\n\n### Scheduled upgrade from 22.04 LTS\n\nUsers of Ubuntu Budgie 22.04 LTS will not be prompted to upgrade to 22.10 automatically. Remember the upgrade path for most LTS users is from LTS to LTS i.e. 22.04 to 24.04. LTS versions are focused on stability.\n\n### Manual upgrade from 22.04\n\nAfter the release of 22.10, ensure you change your Software Sources to offer updates for any version:\n\n[![](images/wp_editor_md_34f6ab29d9728ad3e078317aaafffcc0.jpg)](https://ubuntubudgie.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/wp_editor_md_34f6ab29d9728ad3e078317aaafffcc0.jpg)\n\nYou will then be offered to upgrade when you run Software & Updates.\n\n## Where to download Ubuntu Budgie daily builds and final releases\n\n### Daily and Beta builds\n\nUbuntu Budgie daily builds for AMD64 architecture are available here: [http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-budgie/daily-live/current/](http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-budgie/daily-live/current/)\n\nUbuntu Budgie beta build for RaspberryPI is available here: [Download Link](https://sourceforge.net/projects/budgie-remix/files/budgie-raspi-22.10/)\n\n### Final Releases\n\nLinks to download final releases, as well as installation instructions, will be available on our Ubuntu Budgie website once Final Release is built: [https://ubuntubudgie.org/downloads/](https://ubuntubudgie.org/downloads/).\n\n## Known Issues\n\n- For more generic issues with Ubuntu 22.10, please check this link: [Ubuntu 22.10 Release Notes](https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/kinetic-kudu-release-notes/27976).\n\n## Infrastructure Sponsors\n\nWe just wanted to thank our infrastructure sponsors who help us keep the lights on.\n\n### Digital Ocean\n\nOn a mission to simplify cloud computing so developers and their teams can spend more time building software that changes the world.\n\n### Discourse\n\nDiscourse is the 100% open source discussion platform built for the next decade of the Internet.

For those who prefer \"classic\", visual edge tiling however, the built-in version is quite limited, and there's a lot to win in that area.\n\nThe choice to use Shuffler daemon as a starting point was obvious, since that's the place where most of the information to work with was already available.\n\n### Features\n\n#### Built-in\n\nThe currently used built-in feature offers left/right half and full screen tiling:  \n  \n![](images/builtin_edgetiling-744x98.png)\n\n#### Drag-snap\n\nThe goal for our new _Drag-snap_ was to _at least_ cover the areas below:  \n  \n![](images/dragsnap_default-744x95.png)  \nQuarter & half tiling is pretty much self-explaining.  \nDragging a window to the top of the screen will tile the window to top half, but keeping the mouse button pressed will progress the action into full screen tiling.\n\n#### Asymetric tiling\n\n_Symetric_ quarter & half tiling, dividing the screen in two or four equally sized areas, will do in many cases. just as often though, we don't want our windows to be equally sized, horizontally, but for example like this:  \n  \n![](images/dragsnap_asym-744x98.png)  \nWith traditional tiling, this would not be possible.  \nDrag-snap however adds two modifier keys, invoking a slightly different behavior:\n\n- Alt + drag will tile the window into 3/5 of the screen width\n- Control + drag will tile the window into 2/5 of the screen width\n\n\\[video width=\"960\" height=\"540\" m4v=\"https://ubuntubudgie.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/asymetric\\_tiling.m4v\"\\]\\[/video\\]\n\n#### Integration with the desktop\n\nIf we drag a window into a corner of the screen, we might unintentionally fire a hotcorner action.

Hotcorners was completely rewritten and redesigned, to replace the current applet. There are significant differences, both from the user's perspective and from a technical point of view.\n\n![](images/hotcorners_settings-744x608.png)\n\n### From a user experience point of view:\n\n- Hotspot areas are now extended to 8 spots (all edges & corners)\n- The settings interface now has a dedicated window. The applet is still available for quick access to hotcorner settings, but is optional.\n\n![](images/hcapplet-744x252.png)\n\n- The options to set pressure and/or delay no longer exclude each other, so the user can fine tune his or her own touch to prevent unintended firing.\n- Hotcorners now has another built-in feature to prevent unintended firing. When for example text is selected and we unavoidably hit the edge of the screen, the corresponding command could be triggered. Hotcorners therefore checks for mouse button 1 to be pressed, skips action if that is the case.\n\n### From a technical point of view\n\n- Hotcorners process now stands on its own feet, is no longer run inside the panel's thread. The applet is still available, but its task is limited , and hotcorner's settings is also available from the desktop menu.\n\n![](images/sloppy_corner-744x126.png)\n\n- New features require new procedures: we now have eight spots… If we for example set both the left edge, _and_ top left of the screen for an action, there is a reasonable chance that we hit the left or top edge before the top left corner. In such a case, we wouldn't want to fire the action for the edge, that we accidentally hit first, but the corner action that we aim for. If we hit two hot spots in a row, immediately after each other, (within 125 ms to be precise) hotcorners will consider the final one to be valid.\n\nWhat stayed the same is that Hotcorners offers a number of preset commands from a dropdown list.

We have also made this available via our backports-budgie PPA for our 22.04 LTS community:\n\n```\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntubudgie/backports-budgie && sudo apt full-upgrade\n```\n\nThis is the new version of the Budgie Desktop [v10.7](https://blog.buddiesofbudgie.org/budgie-10-7-released/) from the BuddiesOfBudgie organisation which Ubuntu Budgie are a key contributor to.\n\nThis is a precis of upstreams release note:\n\nBudgie 10.7.1 is a brand new release series for Budgie Desktop, featuring major re-architectures, new APIs for extensibility, and polish to the user experience.\n\n## New Application Indexer\n\nBudgie 10.7.1 introduces a new application indexer, replacing our use of libgnome-menus and unifying our logic used in both Budgie Menu and Budgie Run Dialog, for consistency in the applications we show. This new indexer provides more reliable indexing of applications across several directories which are used to store desktop files.\n\nOur implementation improves the categorization of applications, aggregating entries into more relevant and used categories (for example, \"Administation\", \"Settings\", and \"System\" would all be aggregated into \"System\"), while respecting custom desktop directories created by the users through third-party menu editors that write to the user's `.local/share/desktop-directories` folder.\n\nRelated to the application indexer, our searching in Budgie Menu has been abstracted out into its own \"relevancy search\" that is now used in both Budgie Menu and Budgie Run Dialog, providing a consistent search experience.\n\n## Budgie Desktop Settings\n\n\nBudgie Desktop Settings now has a new design for widget selection, applying to both panel widgets and our new Raven widget system. This design shows relevant developer information such as the author, website, description, and copyright information. We also communicate if the widget plugin is \"built-in\" (ships with Budgie).\n\n## Budgie Menu\n\n\nBudgie Menu has been drastically improved in 10.7.1, with new functionality and improvements to application launching.\n\nFor Ubuntu Budgie use the \"Budgie Menu\" applet instead of the default Budgie AppMenu\n\n### Dual-GPU Support\n\nBudgie Menu now leverages [switcheroo-control](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/hadess/switcheroo-control) if available to switch between GPU environments when launching applications that request it. Users with dual-GPU setups can now launch their applications without necessarily having to worry about which GPU is in use and manually switching between them.\n\n### Personal User Menu\n\nBudgie Menu now provides a \"personal user menu\" which has quick XDG directory access. This feature enables you to open up a file manager (or technically whatever your inode/directory handler is) directly to folders like Home, Documents, Music, etc. This follows the [XDG Base Directory Specification](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html), so if you have for example a different path set for Music (**or your system locale is not English**) that will be respected. Folders which do not exist will be automatically hidden, so the menu will only show items which are relevant to you!\n\n### Quick Settings and Power Access\n\nIn the new bottom strip of Budgie Menu, we now have buttons for launching Budgie Desktop Settings, Budgie Control Center, and our new Power Dialog (which we will get into later). You no longer need to search for these in the menu or access them by right-clicking on the desktop.\n\n### Improvements to accessing Budgie Control Center panels\n\n\n\nAn option has been added to the Budgie Menu widget settings to show Budgie Control Center settings items (such as bluetooth, sound, and power panels) in the applications list. You will always be able to search for these items regardless of the option being enabled though, so you can have less clutter in your menu while still having quick access to various settings panels.\n\n### Other Improvements\n\nHere is a short list of other improvements to Budgie Menu:\n\n- We no longer reload the Budgie Menu during a AppIndex change when the menu is open, preventing your category and application list from re-rendering while you are actively using the menu.\n- We now ship a default menu icon that is similar in design to the grid icon that is used when the user enables the new \"Use Default Menu Icon\" option in the Budgie Menu widget settings, or if the currently selected icon theme is in the following list:\n    - Adwaita\n    - HighContrast\n    - hicolor\n    - \"default\"\n\n## Budgie Run Dialog\n\nBudgie Run Dialog has been updated in 10.7 to leverage the new application indexer and relevancy search service, enabling it to have consistent search results compared to Budgie Menu.\n\nAlongside this update, we have introduced a couple visual changes as well:\n\n1. The width is now computed from the work area of the screen that the Run Dialog is opened on. This should make it look good on different sized monitors.\n2. The label for the name and description of applications in the launcher buttons has been split into two labels. This allows more fine-grained styling than was previously possible.\n\n## Budgie Screenshot\n\nBudgie 10.7.1 introduces a new Budgie Screenshot application built into the desktop that enables you to quickly take screenshots of windows, areas, or your entire screen. Budgie Desktop no longer relies on gnome-screenshot for its screenshotting capabilities, all of the existing default keybinds will now call `org.buddiesofbudgie.BudgieScreenshot`. Users still have the option to use a different screenshotting solution (e.g. Flameshot) should they desire.\n\n## Notification Enhancements\n\nSignificant improvements around Notifications have landed in 10.7.1.\n\n### General UX Improvements\n\nThere has been a swath of improvements to our rendering of notifications:\n\n- Notifications will now fade in and out upon showing and closing.\n- Fix large fonts pushing the close button out of the popup\n    - This sets the notification body to use the size of the widget for wrapping instead of a character length. Notification titles also were given a margin-end to prevent overlapping the close button.\n- Prevent notification popups from stealing input focus\n- Notifications should no longer cause screen flickering when in a fullscreen application.\n\n\n- Width chars were added so that the body text always has the same minimum and maximum size per line, so the entire popup body is filled by the label. Lines is set to 2, so only two lines of text is displayed. Note that this does not mean two lines in the popup; it's two lines of the actual notification text. This allows long lines to wrap (and wrapped lines don't count towards lines, because reasons) without popups taking up large amounts of screen real-estate. Xalign is set to 0 to ensure that the text always starts at the left (because halign and justify isn't enough).\n\n### Notification Summary\n\nWhen a window leaves fullscreen mode, Budgie will now show a notification popup to alert the user that there are notifications that they didn't see. This notification is only shown if there are actually notifications.\n\n### Spec and Control Center Setting Compliance\n\nImprovements have been made in supporting more of the FreeDesktop Notification spec, namely notification sounds are now supported. As not all applications will be displayed currently in Budgie Control Center and some applications such as Element and Discord have separate capabilities to play notifications sounds, we do not have sounds enabled by default.\n\nApplications that show in Budgie Control Center under its Notifications panel can be configured to have sounds on or off. Alongside this, we now respect the \"Show Message Content in Popups\" option in Budgie Control Center's Notification panel for an application and will hide content when it is disabled there.\n\nSome notifications set a timeout of 0, which the spec says means that it should never expire. Our implementation doesn't really fit that, since persistence is done by Raven, not the notification server. As such, we set a different minimum show time for the popups to ensure that one is actually shown when it should be.\n\n## Raven\n\nBudgie 10.7.1 introduces the largest set of changes and features since the 10.5 release. It has largely been re-architected with a brand new pluggable Raven widget API system, allowing third-party developers to build their own Raven widgets, as well as seeing new widgets and updated designs to existing widgets.\n\n### Raven Widget API\n\n\nLike our Budgie Panel widget API, you can now build widgets for Raven leveraging libpeas (providing support for writing plugins in C, Python, and Vala) and our set of APIs. This **finally achieves** our end goal for Raven since the beginning of Budgie 10, which has been to provide a extensible widget and notification center.\n\nThis documentation, like the panel API, is currently provided via gtk-doc and browsable via [devhelp](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Devhelp). In the future, it will be available directly from our documentation center with reference examples.\n\n\nThese widgets will automatically show up in Budgie Desktop Settings.\n\nAs a result of this re-architecture around Raven and leveraging past work on the panel widget plugin API, Raven widgets can now be positioned to your heart's content and you can even remove the ones you don't want (as opposed to just hiding them like our past implementation). All of the widgets that ship with Budgie Desktop leverage the same plugin architecture as third-party ones will.\n\n### New and improved Raven widgets\n\n\nBudgie 10.7.1 includes updates to some of our existing Raven widgets alongside a brand new one!\n\n- The Media Player widget now has a more compact design.\n- You can now click on the widget header icons for sound output and input to mute the respective device.\n- You can now turn off day names in the Calendar widget.\n- We now have a new Raven widget called Usage Monitor. This is a minimalistic widget that displays CPU, RAM, and Swap usage.\n\n### Other Changes\n\nHere is a short list of some other changes to Raven:\n\n- The Power Strip, which has been off by default since 10.5, has been deprecated in favor of our improvements around the power dialog and more accessible power options via Budgie Menu.\n- Refinements have been made to margins and paddings of widget components.\n- Notifications are now sorted oldest to newest.\n\n## Power Dialog\n\n\nBudgie 10.7.1 introduces a new Power Dialog for common actions such as shutdown, reboot, suspend, and more. This functionality replaces the actions exposed through the User Indicator applet, no longer requiring it to be added to the panel. The User Indicator will now invoke the Power Dialog and the new button in Budgie Menu will do the same!\n\nThe Power Dialog is invokable through D-Bus, allowing third-party applet developers such as those making their own menu implementations to easily incorporate our power dialog options without much effort or requiring them to implement duplicate functionality. You can also invoke the power dialog with our handy (Win/Super)+Shift+P keybind.\n\nHibernation is dynamically enabled / disabled based off system support and is offered as a compile-time option to disable on operating systems which do not provide hibernation support out-of-the-box, such as Fedora.\n\n## Other Improvements and Bug Fixes\n\n### Bug Fixes\n\n- Fix repeated terminal messages about non-existent desktop-directories folder. [#232](https://github.com/BuddiesOfBudgie/budgie-desktop/issues/232)\n- Ubuntu Budgie dev Jacob has fixed two key long outstanding notifications issues.\n    - Approx 800 or more notifications caused raven to not animate correctly, take a long time to appear. Now in total approx 500 notifications are held in raven and each notification group displays the latest 25 notifications\n    - Notifications that were not acknowledged could over time cause budgie-panel to become unresponsive. These memory issues has now been resolved.\n\n### Other Improvements\n\nIconTasklist icons will now be scaled to the target size of approximately 2/3 that of the size of the panel itself, up to an icon size of 54px, where it shifts to the panel size minus 18. This allows for icons to scale to much smaller and much larger sizes, while retaining desirable icon sizes for dock setups, and while maintaining the same icon size for the default panel size of 36px.\n\n- Add dock ability for panel.ini / layouts. [#88](https://github.com/BuddiesOfBudgie/budgie-desktop/issues/88)\n- Configurable size for the Workspace switcher widget, enabling a selection of predefined multipliers for how many icons to show in each workspace. [#163](https://github.com/BuddiesOfBudgie/budgie-desktop/issues/163)\n- Move polkit and power dialogs to libexecdir.

We have also made this available via our backports-budgie PPA for our 22.04 LTS community:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cpre class=\"astro-code github-dark\" style=\"background-color:#24292e;color:#e1e4e8; overflow-x: auto;\" tabindex=\"0\" data-language=\"plaintext\">\u003Ccode>\u003Cspan class=\"line\">\u003Cspan>sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntubudgie/backports-budgie &#x26;&#x26; sudo apt full-upgrade\u003C/span>\u003C/span>\u003C/code>\u003C/pre>\n\u003Cp>This is the new version of the Budgie Desktop \u003Ca href=\"https://blog.buddiesofbudgie.org/budgie-10-7-released/\">v10.7\u003C/a> from the BuddiesOfBudgie organisation which Ubuntu Budgie are a key contributor to.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>This is a precis of upstreams release note:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Budgie 10.7.1 is a brand new release series for Budgie Desktop, featuring major re-architectures, new APIs for extensibility, and polish to the user experience.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"new-application-indexer\">New Application Indexer\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Budgie 10.7.1 introduces a new application indexer, replacing our use of libgnome-menus and unifying our logic used in both Budgie Menu and Budgie Run Dialog, for consistency in the applications we show. This new indexer provides more reliable indexing of applications across several directories which are used to store desktop files.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Our implementation improves the categorization of applications, aggregating entries into more relevant and used categories (for example, “Administation”, “Settings”, and “System” would all be aggregated into “System”), while respecting custom desktop directories created by the users through third-party menu editors that write to the user’s \u003Ccode>.local/share/desktop-directories\u003C/code> folder.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Related to the application indexer, our searching in Budgie Menu has been abstracted out into its own “relevancy search” that is now used in both Budgie Menu and Budgie Run Dialog, providing a consistent search experience.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"budgie-desktop-settings\">Budgie Desktop Settings\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Budgie Desktop Settings now has a new design for widget selection, applying to both panel widgets and our new Raven widget system. This design shows relevant developer information such as the author, website, description, and copyright information. We also communicate if the widget plugin is “built-in” (ships with Budgie).\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"budgie-menu\">Budgie Menu\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Budgie Menu has been drastically improved in 10.7.1, with new functionality and improvements to application launching.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>For Ubuntu Budgie use the “Budgie Menu” applet instead of the default Budgie AppMenu\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"dual-gpu-support\">Dual-GPU Support\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Budgie Menu now leverages \u003Ca href=\"https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/hadess/switcheroo-control\">switcheroo-control\u003C/a> if available to switch between GPU environments when launching applications that request it. Users with dual-GPU setups can now launch their applications without necessarily having to worry about which GPU is in use and manually switching between them.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"personal-user-menu\">Personal User Menu\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Budgie Menu now provides a “personal user menu” which has quick XDG directory access. This feature enables you to open up a file manager (or technically whatever your inode/directory handler is) directly to folders like Home, Documents, Music, etc. This follows the \u003Ca href=\"https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html\">XDG Base Directory Specification\u003C/a>, so if you have for example a different path set for Music (\u003Cstrong>or your system locale is not English\u003C/strong>) that will be respected. Folders which do not exist will be automatically hidden, so the menu will only show items which are relevant to you!\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"quick-settings-and-power-access\">Quick Settings and Power Access\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>In the new bottom strip of Budgie Menu, we now have buttons for launching Budgie Desktop Settings, Budgie Control Center, and our new Power Dialog (which we will get into later). You no longer need to search for these in the menu or access them by right-clicking on the desktop.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"improvements-to-accessing-budgie-control-center-panels\">Improvements to accessing Budgie Control Center panels\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>An option has been added to the Budgie Menu widget settings to show Budgie Control Center settings items (such as bluetooth, sound, and power panels) in the applications list. You will always be able to search for these items regardless of the option being enabled though, so you can have less clutter in your menu while still having quick access to various settings panels.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"other-improvements\">Other Improvements\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Here is a short list of other improvements to Budgie Menu:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>We no longer reload the Budgie Menu during a AppIndex change when the menu is open, preventing your category and application list from re-rendering while you are actively using the menu.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>We now ship a default menu icon that is similar in design to the grid icon that is used when the user enables the new “Use Default Menu Icon” option in the Budgie Menu widget settings, or if the currently selected icon theme is in the following list:\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>Adwaita\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>HighContrast\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>hicolor\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>“default”\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ul>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ul>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"budgie-run-dialog\">Budgie Run Dialog\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Budgie Run Dialog has been updated in 10.7 to leverage the new application indexer and relevancy search service, enabling it to have consistent search results compared to Budgie Menu.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Alongside this update, we have introduced a couple visual changes as well:\u003C/p>\n\u003Col>\n\u003Cli>The width is now computed from the work area of the screen that the Run Dialog is opened on. This should make it look good on different sized monitors.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>The label for the name and description of applications in the launcher buttons has been split into two labels. This allows more fine-grained styling than was previously possible.\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ol>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"budgie-screenshot\">Budgie Screenshot\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Budgie 10.7.1 introduces a new Budgie Screenshot application built into the desktop that enables you to quickly take screenshots of windows, areas, or your entire screen. Budgie Desktop no longer relies on gnome-screenshot for its screenshotting capabilities, all of the existing default keybinds will now call \u003Ccode>org.buddiesofbudgie.BudgieScreenshot\u003C/code>. Users still have the option to use a different screenshotting solution (e.g. Flameshot) should they desire.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"notification-enhancements\">Notification Enhancements\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Significant improvements around Notifications have landed in 10.7.1.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"general-ux-improvements\">General UX Improvements\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>There has been a swath of improvements to our rendering of notifications:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>Notifications will now fade in and out upon showing and closing.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>Fix large fonts pushing the close button out of the popup\u003C/p>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>This sets the notification body to use the size of the widget for wrapping instead of a character length. Notification titles also were given a margin-end to prevent overlapping the close button.\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ul>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>Prevent notification popups from stealing input focus\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>Notifications should no longer cause screen flickering when in a fullscreen application.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>Width chars were added so that the body text always has the same minimum and maximum size per line, so the entire popup body is filled by the label. Lines is set to 2, so only two lines of text is displayed. Note that this does not mean two lines in the popup; it’s two lines of the actual notification text. This allows long lines to wrap (and wrapped lines don’t count towards lines, because reasons) without popups taking up large amounts of screen real-estate. Xalign is set to 0 to ensure that the text always starts at the left (because halign and justify isn’t enough).\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ul>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"notification-summary\">Notification Summary\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>When a window leaves fullscreen mode, Budgie will now show a notification popup to alert the user that there are notifications that they didn’t see. This notification is only shown if there are actually notifications.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"spec-and-control-center-setting-compliance\">Spec and Control Center Setting Compliance\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Improvements have been made in supporting more of the FreeDesktop Notification spec, namely notification sounds are now supported. As not all applications will be displayed currently in Budgie Control Center and some applications such as Element and Discord have separate capabilities to play notifications sounds, we do not have sounds enabled by default.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Applications that show in Budgie Control Center under its Notifications panel can be configured to have sounds on or off. Alongside this, we now respect the “Show Message Content in Popups” option in Budgie Control Center’s Notification panel for an application and will hide content when it is disabled there.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Some notifications set a timeout of 0, which the spec says means that it should never expire. Our implementation doesn’t really fit that, since persistence is done by Raven, not the notification server. As such, we set a different minimum show time for the popups to ensure that one is actually shown when it should be.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"raven\">Raven\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Budgie 10.7.1 introduces the largest set of changes and features since the 10.5 release. It has largely been re-architected with a brand new pluggable Raven widget API system, allowing third-party developers to build their own Raven widgets, as well as seeing new widgets and updated designs to existing widgets.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"raven-widget-api\">Raven Widget API\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Like our Budgie Panel widget API, you can now build widgets for Raven leveraging libpeas (providing support for writing plugins in C, Python, and Vala) and our set of APIs. This \u003Cstrong>finally achieves\u003C/strong> our end goal for Raven since the beginning of Budgie 10, which has been to provide a extensible widget and notification center.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>This documentation, like the panel API, is currently provided via gtk-doc and browsable via \u003Ca href=\"https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Devhelp\">devhelp\u003C/a>. In the future, it will be available directly from our documentation center with reference examples.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>These widgets will automatically show up in Budgie Desktop Settings.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>As a result of this re-architecture around Raven and leveraging past work on the panel widget plugin API, Raven widgets can now be positioned to your heart’s content and you can even remove the ones you don’t want (as opposed to just hiding them like our past implementation). All of the widgets that ship with Budgie Desktop leverage the same plugin architecture as third-party ones will.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"new-and-improved-raven-widgets\">New and improved Raven widgets\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Budgie 10.7.1 includes updates to some of our existing Raven widgets alongside a brand new one!\u003C/p>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>The Media Player widget now has a more compact design.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>You can now click on the widget header icons for sound output and input to mute the respective device.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>You can now turn off day names in the Calendar widget.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>We now have a new Raven widget called Usage Monitor.

This functionality replaces the actions exposed through the User Indicator applet, no longer requiring it to be added to the panel. The User Indicator will now invoke the Power Dialog and the new button in Budgie Menu will do the same!\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The Power Dialog is invokable through D-Bus, allowing third-party applet developers such as those making their own menu implementations to easily incorporate our power dialog options without much effort or requiring them to implement duplicate functionality. You can also invoke the power dialog with our handy (Win/Super)+Shift+P keybind.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Hibernation is dynamically enabled / disabled based off system support and is offered as a compile-time option to disable on operating systems which do not provide hibernation support out-of-the-box, such as Fedora.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"other-improvements-and-bug-fixes\">Other Improvements and Bug Fixes\u003C/h2>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"bug-fixes\">Bug Fixes\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>Fix repeated terminal messages about non-existent desktop-directories folder. \u003Ca href=\"https://github.com/BuddiesOfBudgie/budgie-desktop/issues/232\">#232\u003C/a>\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Ubuntu Budgie dev Jacob has fixed two key long outstanding notifications issues.\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>Approx 800 or more notifications caused raven to not animate correctly, take a long time to appear.

If stability is more important than having the latest and greatest version of the kernel, desktop environment, and applications then Ubuntu Budgie 22.04 LTS is perfect for you.\n\nIn these release notes, we are going to cover the following items:\n\n- Release schedule\n- New features and enhancements\n- Upgrade from 22.04 LTS\n- Upgrade from 22.10\n- Where to download Ubuntu Budgie daily, beta and final releases\n- Infrastructure Sponsors\n\n## Release Schedule\n\nIf you want to learn more, please see Release planning and scheduling, shared by Canonical on this post [https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/lunar-lobster-release-schedule](https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/lunar-lobster-release-schedule)\n\n## New Features and Enhancements\n\n### Budgie Desktop & Budgie Control Center\n\nWe are pleased to include the very latest budgie desktop version in 23.04. This is a really great release - do read whats new and changed in our [blog post](https://ubuntubudgie.org/2023/04/budgie-desktop-10-7-x/).\n\n### Applets and mini-apps\n\nFor Ubuntu Budgie applets these can be tested via our daily PPA for 22.04/22.10 & 23.04:\n\n`sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntubudgie-dev/budgie-extras-daily && sudo apt upgrade`\n\n1. Lots of updated translations from our brilliant translators [https://www.transifex.com/ubuntu-budgie/](https://www.transifex.com/ubuntu-budgie/)\n2. Clockworks applet - clocks can now vary by up to 24hrs\n3. Weather Applet Icons have been reworked to work better against both light and dark themes\n\n![file](images/image-1681235209469.png)\n\n![file](images/image-1681235233596.png)\n\n4. Fix for ShowTime, Weather applet disappearing from the desktop after logon\n5. Weather applet now allows searching by locale characters i.e. not just plain ascii\n6. Both screenshot applet and haste applet have now been [archived](https://discourse.ubuntubudgie.org/t/testing-23-04-are-you-brave-enough/6380/9?u=fossfreedom) by its author and as such we will be removing the ability to install these applets for 23.04. We will leave the for 22.04 & 22.10 since these are stable releases - if we are notified that capability is seriously broken we will also remove these applets from these releases as well.\n7. Ubuntu Budgie developer, Sam, has updated his personal project budgie-analogue-applet. This now displays correctly when fractional scaling is used. In addition, the clock is available as a Raven widget to be added.\n\n![file](images/image-1681235259705.png)\n\n8. Ubuntu Budgie dev Jacob has [improved hotcorners](https://ubuntubudgie.org/2023/02/new-hotcorners-feature-introduced-in-23-04/)\n\n![file](images/image-1681235281186.png)\n\n- Hotspot areas are now extended to 8 spots (all edges & corners)\n- The settings interface now has a dedicated window. The applet is still available for quick access to hotcorner settings, but is optional.\n\n![](images/hcapplet-744x252.png)\n\n- The options to set pressure and/or delay no longer exclude each other, so the user can fine tune his or her own touch to prevent unintended firing.\n- Hotcorners now has another built-in feature to prevent unintended firing. When for example text is selected and we unavoidably hit the edge of the screen, the corresponding command could be triggered. Hotcorners therefore checks for mouse button 1 to be pressed, skips action if that is the case.\n\n9. [Window Shuffler](https://ubuntubudgie.org/2023/01/new-edge-tiling-introduced-in-23-04/) has undergone a dramatic rework by Jacob. Now available is quarter tiling both keyboard and using a mouse via a feature we call Drag Snap\n\n![](images/dragsnap_default-744x95.png) Quarter & half tiling is pretty much self-explaining. Dragging a window to the top of the screen will tile the window to top half, but keeping the mouse button pressed will progress the action into full screen tiling.\n\nAlso available is asymmetric tiling by pressing Alt or Ctrl whilst dragging\n\n- Alt + drag will tile the window into 3/5 of the screen width\n- Control + drag will tile the window into 2/5 of the screen width\n\n10. From the BuddiesOfBudgie team member EbonJaeger is a new applet that replaces the new default user indictor with a more traditional looking applet\n\n![file](images/image-1681235354892.png)\n\n### Raspberry Pi\n\n1. Budgie Pi VNC options are now per user instead of a system wide.\n2. Added a few options like \"prompt to accept connection\" and the view only mode.\n3. Added a popup notification when a remote machine connects.\n4. Also the restriction to accept connections only from the local subnet can be disabled. Another benefit is since this server uses a password hash file instead of gnome keyring, we don't have to recommend to disable the keyring password so the VNC server accepts connections if auto-login is on.\n\n![file](images/image-1681235385533.png) ![file](images/image-1681235398470.png)\n\n5. the Remote Pi options is a little cleaner and more consistent, and no more UI freezes during installs\n\n### Themes\n\n1. Pocillo Theme includes a fix for chrome and chromium showing the background in a 1px wide divider\n2. Latest Pocillo Icons derived from Qogir & Tela icons - incorporates over a years worth of enhancements\n3. Latest QogirBudgie theme derived from Qogir upstream. The Dark and Light theme variants have been renamed slightly (capitalised). Thus on an upgrade these themes will need to be applied via budgie desktop settings\n4. Latest upstream Mojave Gtk Theme\n5. Latest upstream WhiteSur Gtk Theme\n6. Latest upstream WhiteSur Icon Theme\n7. Latest upstream Orchis Gtk Theme\n8. Latest upstream Vimix Gtk Theme\n9. Latest upstream Tela Circle Theme\n\n### Budgie Welcome\n\nOur welcome app is automatically updated for all 22.04 & 22.10 users\n\n1. Lots of updated translations from our brilliant translators [https://www.transifex.com/ubuntu-budgie/](https://www.transifex.com/ubuntu-budgie/)\n2. Welcome snap updated to install 23.04 budgie-extras etc.\n3. The front page icons now are fixed rather than trying to be translated. This prevents locale characters such as chinese being displayed.\n4. Mysteriously Chromium Browser disappeared as an option for the browser ballot. This now has been resolved.\n\n### Additional\n\n1. Our default terminal font is now Noto Mono Bold size 11. For the raspi image this will be Noto Mono Regular size 11.\n\nWe have changed the font due to changes made by Canonical in Lunar with the Ubuntu Mono font we previously used for many year which we do not feel work for our distro.\n\n### Areas to look out for\n\n1. For the beta we have noted the following GNOME based issues impacting budgie-desktop:\n    - Some windows doesn't grab focus on [titlebar click](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/mutter/-/issues/2727)\n    - Title bar becomes transparent and other glitches from an [XWayland window](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/mutter/-/issues/2725)\n    - Window rectangle does not match cursor's assumed [rectangle on X11](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/mutter/-/issues/2706)\n    - Incorrect window placement with respect to mouse [cursor during move](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/mutter/-/issues/2730)\n2. The following issue we have noted with budgie related components:\n    - window shuffler crashes on ubuntu - [wayland session](https://github.com/UbuntuBudgie/budgie-extras/issues/446)\n    - on QEMU/KVM and possibly VirtualBox, adjusting the screen-resolution via budgie-control-center followed by reopening budgie-control-center crashes the whole desktop. This is likely due to a mutter bug. Resetting the last-panel dconf key for budgie-control-center will allow budgie-control-center to be reopened again.\n3. The following snap issue that impact UB:\n    - installing missing theme [snaps failed](https://github.com/snapcore/snapd-desktop-integration/issues/52)\n4. Areas of concern that we haven't yet seen bug reports:\n    - often, we see the resize cursor where there is nothing to resize - likely a mutter issue\n    - Applying a dark theme for example \"Pocillo-dark\" with a \"Prefer dark\" styling defaults the GTK3 standard window decoration to use Dark Adwaita styling. Changing the styling to \"Application Preference\" can help. This is definitely a change from 22.04 and 22.10.\n    - touchscreen, cursor disappears to never come back unless restarting budgie-wm\n5. Whilst investigating the above we note the following GNOME-Shell issues:\n    - a restart or shutdown is not possible without the reset button.\n    - On gnome-shell: desktop freezes when touchscreen is pressed\n\n## Upgrading from previous releases\n\nIt is important to keep in mind a few useful tips before attempting a release upgrade:\n\n- Backup your data.\n- Install all available updates and reboot.\n- It is always a good idea to run either a full system snapshot with Timeshift, to a secondary drive, or a full system image using Clonezilla.\n- If you have PPAs that come with updated kernel, mesa, GPU drivers, it is better to purge those PPAs and reboot before attempting release upgrade.\n- Once release upgrade starts, all your PPAs will be disabled. If you rely on important software from PPAs, it is better to manually check if those are updated for upcoming release of Ubuntu.\n- After upgrade is completed, remember to go to software sources, change release name on your PPAs, enable them and refresh package cache.\n\n### Scheduled upgrade from 22.04 LTS\n\nUsers of Ubuntu Budgie 22.04 LTS will not be prompted to upgrade to 23.04 automatically. Remember the upgrade path for most LTS users is from LTS to LTS i.e. 22.04 to 24.04. LTS versions are focused on stability.\n\n### Manual upgrade from 22.04 to 23.04\n\nThere is no direct route to upgrade to 23.04 to 22.04. You must first upgrade to 22.10 before upgrading to 23.04.\n\nPlease read the 22.10 [release notes](https://ubuntubudgie.org/2022/09/ubuntu-budgie-22-10-release-notes/) for this procedure.\n\n### Upgrade from 22.10 to 23.04\n\nIMPORTANT: remember to double-check you have the following vital package before you upgrade:\n\n```\nsudo apt install ubuntu-budgie-desktop\n```\n\nA few days/week or two after the formal release of 23.04 in April you will be automatically offered a graphical prompt to upgrade.\n\nAlternatively, from a command line run:\n\n```\nupdate-manager\n```\n\nSome of the packages that were installed as part of the Ubuntu Budgie backports PPA (ppa:ubuntubudgie/backports) will be uninstalled as part of the upgrade. Use budgie-welcome to reinstall anything that is removed.\n\nPlease refer to the community wiki for more help:\n\n[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Upgrades](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Upgrades)\n\nAlso, Ask Ubuntu has an excellent guide to help you upgrade:\n\n[http://askubuntu.com/questions/110477/how-do-i-upgrade-to-a-newer-version-of-ubuntu](http://askubuntu.com/questions/110477/how-do-i-upgrade-to-a-newer-version-of-ubuntu)\n\n## Where to download Ubuntu Budgie daily builds and final releases\n\n### Daily and Beta builds\n\nUbuntu Budgie daily builds for AMD64 architecture are available here: [http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-budgie/daily-live/current/](http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-budgie/daily-live/current/)\n\n### Final Releases\n\nLinks to download final releases, as well as installation instructions, will be available on our Ubuntu Budgie website once Final Release is built: [https://ubuntubudgie.org/downloads/](https://ubuntubudgie.org/downloads/).\n\n## Known Issues\n\n- For more generic issues with Ubuntu 23.04, please check this link: [Ubuntu 23.04 Release Notes](https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/lunar-lobster-release-notes).\n\n## Infrastructure Sponsors\n\nWe just wanted to thank our infrastructure sponsors who help us keep the lights on.\n\n### Digital Ocean\n\nOn a mission to simplify cloud computing so developers and their teams can spend more time building software that changes the world.\n\n### Discourse\n\nDiscourse is the 100% open source discussion platform built for the next decade of the Internet.

The first step, the most visible part is this website that you are currently reading this post on. The website itself is powered by a WordPress installation. There were a lot of discussions on what to use for our website among the team, ranging from custom CMS, static HTML, Grav and other CMS (Content Management System).\n\nMost of the posts are written in Markdown that is then converted to HTML when publishing a post. Some of you may be wondering why Markdown as choice, doesn't WordPress use WYSIWYG (What you see is what you get) editor? While this is true, markdown allows us to be lean and write from anywhere and at any time and just get text ready for publishing. There is no need to login and start writing from a browser. We can write a post from a code editor and then copy/paste. Other parts of the website however are managed using WYSIWYG editor, such as Downloads page, About us, etc.\n\nWe currently host our website on a Digital Ocean droplet, running the Ubuntu Server edition. Digital Ocean has been kind enough to sponsor us with hosting for a few years as of now. To host our website, we are utilizing Docker, but with a twist. Most of the services, such as Database, Apache web server, Traefik, are ran in its own container. This enables us to isolate the problems fairly easy and make sure that one service does not bring down the whole server.\n\n![](images/docker-wordpress-744x372.png)\n\nShared web hosting for example is good for smaller websites, but as you do not have a control over the server, you are dependent on your host for most stuff, with limits included. Plus you always run a risk of someone overusing provisioned space and bandwidth, thus taking you and other websites down that are hosted on shared web server.\n\nAs Ubuntu Budgie is fairly visited website with up to 50.000 to 100.000 monthly visits on release day, having a good setup is a must have to get quickly on our feet in case something goes wrong.\n\nFor example, if there is a bad update or some problem with for example WordPress, we can check the WP container itself without touching other parts of a setup, which would be the usual case when running the default LAMP (Linux, Apache, MariaDB, PHP) server. Having good infrastructure is a necessity to pull this off and quite easy on VPS (Virtual Private Server) or with Digital Ocean. The best of all is that we can backup everything, quickly spin up new droplet and add even more services without endangering the currently running ones.\n\nTo handle the visits, and make sure that you have a good browsing experience, we also utilize CloudFlare, so that we can handle both upcoming traffic, as well our DNS (Domain Name System) hosting needs. For SSL (Secure Sockets Layer), we use LetsEncrypt, that is also an open source and free software as nearly all software mentioned in this article, via certbot to automate the process.\n\nWhile running Ubuntu Budgie, the most important thing we have learned in regards to website and other web oriented services is how important it is to decentralize. If one thing goes down, the whole set of services can go down and you are left stranded. On days such as release days of new Ubuntu Budgie, this is really important since in some cases even a huge amounts of visits could consist of \"hug of death\" that could take down the whole website, making it unavailable. True, you want to have huge amounts of visits, but when unprepared it can create a problem with congestion of huge amount of incoming traffic that you didn't account for when building your infrastructure.\n\nI would like to thank our team member Dustin Krysak, for helping me (Nikola) and other team members with setting up our infrastructure, utilizing his DevOps knowledge, to make sure that everything is up and running in accordance to best practices.","src/content/blog/2023/08/behind-ubuntu-budgie-infrastructure.md",[3682],"images/docker-wordpress-744x372.png","71a9959a8922cea0",{"html":3685,"metadata":3686},"\u003Cp>Making and maintaining a distribution, be it an independent distro or a flavor of a bigger one, such as Ubuntu Budgie, requires a good infrastructure setup to make sure that everything is reliable and functioning like a well oiled machine.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>In case of a Ubuntu Budgie, we made sure to make a setup that is both easy to use and sturdy.

If stability is more important than having the latest and greatest version of the kernel, desktop environment, and applications then Ubuntu Budgie 22.04 LTS is perfect for you.\n\nIn these release notes, we are going to cover the following items:\n\n- Release schedule\n- New features and enhancements\n- Upgrade from 22.04 LTS\n- Upgrade from 23.04\n- Where to download Ubuntu Budgie daily, beta and final releases\n- Infrastructure Sponsors\n\n## Release Schedule\n\nIf you want to learn more, please see Release planning and scheduling, shared by Canonical on this [post](https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/mantic-minotaur-release-schedule/34989).\n\n## New Features and Enhancements\n\n### Budgie Desktop\n\n_The following reiterates the upstream blog announcement for budgie-desktop v10.8 supplemented in italics Ubuntu Budgie specifics._\n\nBudgie 10.8 is a brand new release series for Budgie Desktop, featuring improvements to Budgie Menu _(the alternative menu available to be added to your panel)_, adoption of StatusNotifier support in System Tray _(an alternative to the application indicator that can be added to your panel)_, Magpie v0.x support, and more!\n\n#### Budgie Trash Applet\n\n![|1920x1080](images/image) _Budgie Trash applet allows easy access to the trash folder_\n\nThe previously third-party Budgie Trash Applet, developed by Buddies of Budgie team member Evan Maddock, has been merged into mainline Budgie Desktop to become a part of the default applets available to users out-of-the-box. This trash applet enables the user to quickly access and empty the contents of their trashcan as well as restore files.\n\n#### Magpie v0.x Support\n\nBudgie 10.8 is the first release which includes support for our Magpie ABI. To quickly summarize for those that did not catch our blog post on planned [Wayland support](https://buddiesofbudgie.org/blog/wayland) and may not be familiar with Magpie, as well as to offer a bit of a history lesson, we will quickly go over the important parts.Historically, Budgie Desktop has used GNOME's [Mutter](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/mutter) window manager (nowadays Mutter is also a Wayland compositor) to do the heavy lifting for `budgie-wm`. budgie-wm has served as a small layer on top of Mutter, handling select keybindings for Budgie-specific functionality, input management, animations, screenshot management, backgrounds, and so forth. With every GNOME Stack release, Mutter ABI would change and Budgie Desktop would need to be updated to support the latest ABI and typically two or three ABIs prior so those on older GNOME stacks could still get newer Budgie Desktop releases. On many occasions, this resulted in significant pressure on the team as late ABI changes would land and we would need to work quickly to adapt to them.As GNOME has pursued improvements around their Wayland support, this has understandably at times resulted in regressions in its support for X11. As Budgie Desktop currently uses X11, this has created a less optimal user experience for our users. This reached a turning point with GNOME 44 / mutter-12 ABI when there was a larger split between Wayland and X11 support in Mutter, resulting in many regressions in its X11 support that to this day remain unresolved.During our team discussions, we came to the conclusion that we wanted to address this in two manners:\n\n1. Restore X11 support / functionality expected by our users for the immediate future.\n2. Prioritize adoption of Wayland, a longer-term goal, by developing a wlroots-based compositor that would serve as our window manager for both future Budgie 10.x releases when we go Wayland-only, as well as Budgie 11.\n\nTo accomplish these goals, we first decided to soft-fork Mutter at the state it was in for GNOME 43, eliminating the regressions introduced in GNOME 44 / mutter-12. This version of Magpie is \u003C 1.0 (e.g. 0.9.x) and is designed to be a temporary fork catered to Budgie and its current X11-only support. Alongside this effort, we are building \"Magpie 1.0\" as the wlroots-based Wayland compositor, with the plan to **fully drop X11 support once Magpie 1.0 is ready for consumption**. In the case of Budgie 10.8, this series [supports magpie-0 ABI](https://github.com/BuddiesOfBudgie/budgie-desktop/pull/387), which is effectively identical to the mutter-12 ABI. This provides us a stable ABI that can be leveraged across multiple GNOME Stack releases until Magpie 1.0 is released. Magpie v0.x should be used for GNOME 44+ and we will not be pursuing support for newer mutter ABIs, such as mutter-13 ABI for GNOME 45, as this would not be the most optimal use of our engineering bandwidth over development efforts around Wayland and Budgie 11.\n\n#### Privilege Escalation Dialog Improvements\n\n![|1920x1080](images/image) _Polkit Dialogs now provide an action description_\n\nWonder what is prompting that PolicyKit authentication dialog? Wonder no longer! In this release of Budgie Desktop, our polkit dialog will now show the action description and action ID when graphical privilege escalation is requested.Alongside this change, we made sure the dialog could no longer be resized.\n\n#### Performance / Power Modes In Battery Status Applet\n\n![|1920x1080](images/image) _Quickly switch between different power profile modes_\n\nBudgie's battery indicator in the Status applet now provides the ability to control the Performance / Power profile modes offered by [power-profiles-daemon](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/hadess/power-profiles-daemon?ref=buddiesofbudgie.org). When available on a supported system, you will get access to various options such as:\n\n- Balanced\n- Power Saver\n- Performance\n\n#### System Tray Adopts Status Notifier Specification\n\n_Ubuntu Budgie has had support for Appindicators for many years. The buddies project have developed a new applet which similarly supports Appindicators which can be added to your panel. You cannot have both the Appindicator and the new Status Notifier applet at the same time on your panel._\n\n![|1920x1080](images/image) _System Tray applet using Status Notifier Specification_\n\nThe System Tray applet has been overhauled for Budgie 10.8. As we elaborated on in our [Wayland](https://buddiesofbudgie.org/blog/wayland) blog post, historically we have used either `na-tray` or the XEmbed Protocol for the creation, management, and rendering of trays icons. This had notable downsides, such as:\n\n- Icons not scaling with panel size\n- High DPI scaling relied on the application providing the icon to support DPI scaling\n- Inconsistent styling of tray menus\n- Relies on X11 APIs, which is not viable for our Wayland-only future\n\nFor Budgie 10.8, our System Tray has adopted the [Status Notifier](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Specifications/StatusNotifierItem/) specification. This is a modern, vendor-agnostic solution that enables applications to communicate all relevant information for the rendering of their tray icon over DBus rather than being responsible for drawing tray icons and menus themselves, promoting the development of catered solutions by desktop environments and those developing panels for user experiences such as tiling window managers.The result of this on the Budgie Desktop side is that we can draw all menus and items in a manner that is visually consistent. Going into Budgie 11, we will have a similar solution and paired with multiple panels across multiple monitors (a requirement for Budgie 11), you will even be able to have multiple tray applet instances enabled, which was not otherwise possible with the XEmbed-based solutions.\n\n#### General Improvements\n\nBudgie 10.8 features a bunch of smaller improvements, complementing our major new features and changes.\n\n##### Budgie Menu\n\n![Budgie Menu](images/budgiemenu-1.png \"Budgie Menu\") _The upstream budgie menu is available to be added to your panel via budgie desktop settings._\n\n_The following enhancements and changes have been made by upstream to this upstream applet._\n\nOur Application Indexer's fuzzy scoring function [has been ported to C](https://github.com/BuddiesOfBudgie/budgie-desktop/pull/385). When transpiling to C, Vala would mangle this function, causing it to crash randomly on non-Latin text. Porting it to C fixed the crashing issue while still producing the desired search results.For Budgie Menu, we [made changes](https://github.com/BuddiesOfBudgie/budgie-desktop/pull/388) to the organization of some applications based on user feedback. Applications that previously were put into the Other category ended up fitting better in other existing categories and some application exclusions no longer making sense either. The Utilities category has been removed entirely, as we found it had considerable overlap with the System Tools category and it was not immediately clear what the difference was between Accessories and Utilities. Now, applications previously in Utilities can be found in the System Tools category.\n\n##### Internal Theme Refinements\n\n![Internal Theme](images/budgie-internal-theme.jpg \"Internal Theme\") _The internal theme now features a green accent color, and better contrast_\n\nWe have made some small refinements and recoloring to our internal theme. Historically, the primary accent color in our internal theme mirrored that of the Solus blue. When Budgie Desktop development began under Buddies of Budgie, the decision was made early on to move to our adopted light green primary color. This was chosen to be more like greenery and common (green) budgerigars. The first to be updated was the Budgie logo itself and the color has finally made its way to our default internal theme as well.Alongside this change, we have darkened some elements such as Budgie Menu, the panel, and Raven's background. Raven widgets, text, and iconography should contrast better against the darker background as a result!\n\n##### Other Small Things\n\n- Kvantum and Murrine themes are now hidden in Budgie Desktop Settings [#393](https://github.com/BuddiesOfBudgie/budgie-desktop/pull/393)\n- power-dialog: We have removed style class changes and made it behave more like polkit dialog. This fixes the case where themes which do not style the dialog end up having a transparent background, making it very hard to see and use the dialog [#381](https://github.com/BuddiesOfBudgie/budgie-desktop/pull/381)\n- We now search for plugins in both /usr and /usr/local [#404](https://github.com/BuddiesOfBudgie/budgie-desktop/pull/404)\n- We have moved the battery label setting to Budgie Desktop Settings as well as moved the percentage label from left of icon to right [#389](https://github.com/BuddiesOfBudgie/budgie-desktop/pull/389)\n\n#### Bug Fixes\n\nIt would not be a Budgie release without some bug squashing. In this release, we have:\n\n- Enabled ellipsize for Style boxes in BDS [#403](https://github.com/BuddiesOfBudgie/budgie-desktop/pull/403)\n- Fixed Icon Tasklist not showing Private Internet Access [#379](https://github.com/BuddiesOfBudgie/budgie-desktop/pull/379)\n- Fixed Polkit dialog resizing\n- Prevented notifications and screenshot from locking up when sink is locked\n- keyboard-layout: Don't try to initialize IBus [#418](https://github.com/BuddiesOfBudgie/budgie-desktop/pull/418)\n    - IBus already gets initialized in wm, and calling that function here causes severe breakage, leading to budgie-panel being repeatedly killed for OOM.\n\n### Other Improvements and Bug Fixes\n\n#### Budgie Control Center\n\nWe have uploaded a brand new budgie-control-center to mantic - this incorporates dozens of enhancements and bug fixes that have been pulled together over the last 6 months since the last release.\n\nChangelog here [https://github.com/BuddiesOfBudgie/budgie-control-center/releases/tag/v1.3.0](https://github.com/BuddiesOfBudgie/budgie-control-center/releases/tag/v1.3.0)\n\n#### Budgie Applets and mini-apps\n\n- VisualSpace applet has now an option in Budgie Desktop Settings to reverse the icon scroll direction to switch between workspaces\n- WeatherShow and Applications Menu have been moved to libsoup3 removing the reliance on the deprecated libsoup2.4. These should hopefully be a seamless change but do let us know if you note any crashes/freezes etc.\n- The Extras trash applet is to be removed when budgie-desktop v10.8 is released. This new version has a native trash applet. Where you have previously added the Extras trash applet, it will be removed and you will need to re-add the new built-in trash applet.\n- The Brightness applet no longer resets the night-light setting/colour if it is active when the brightness popover is shown.\n- Wallstreet images are now displayed in alphabetical order rather than in file-system order.\n- A fix to the application indicators to display more chrome based icons has been made - fix has been backported to jammy and lunar as well\n- QuickNote now includes a copy button and a paste button. These perform the same as CTRL+C and CTRL+V in quicknote - quick GUI based method for copy/paste.\n\n![QuickNote](images/quicknote-1.png \"QuickNote\") _New copy/paste buttons in QuickNote_\n\n- QuickNote buttons have gained a tooltip to improved understanding\n- In the budgie desktop v10.8 section upstream removed the legacy xembed based system tray in favour for the Status Notifier applet. There are a number of very old legacy apps still in the archive that use the old panel icons. For 23.10 and 24.04 we have made an optional applet called Budgie Carbon Tray Applet that provides support for these legacy apps. This applet will be dropped in future Ubuntu Budgie releases that will be based on Wayland.\n\n![file](images/image-1695149064732.png) _Carbon Tray Applet supports legacy XEMBED tray apps_\n\n#### Raspberry Pi\n\nSam has been busy again\n\n![file](images/image-1695148694728.png) _The simplicity and elegance of Ubuntu Budgie's desktop experience on a Raspberry Pi_\n\n23.10 raspi beta image is now available.\n\nExpect final image around final release date.\n\nPlease do look at the README and feedback.\n\n[https://sourceforge.net/projects/budgie-remix/files/budgie-raspi-23.10/](https://sourceforge.net/projects/budgie-remix/files/budgie-raspi-23.10/)\n\n1. Default theme corrected as QogirBudgie-Dark - previously QogirBudgie-dark was used which left the desktop with an unthemed look and feel\n2. Minor tweaks to the image creation allows snaps such as Budgie Welcome to be immediately available after initial setup. Firefox will no longer disappear from Plank when logging in quickly after setup completes.\n\n#### Themes\n\n1. Latest WhiteSur gtk theme is now available - and has been backported to lunar\n2. Latest Orchis gtk theme is now available - and has been backported to lunar\n3. Latest Tela-Circle icon theme is now available - and has been backported to jammy and lunar\n4. Brand new Fluent gtk theme is now available - and has been backported to jammy and lunar\n5. Brand new Fluent icons theme is now available - and has been backported to jammy and lunar\n6. Latest WhiteSur-icon theme is now available - and has been backported to jammy and lunar\n7. Latest McMojave-circle icon theme is now available - and has been backported to jammy and lunar\n8. Latest Mojave-gtk-theme is now available - and has been backported to lunar\n\n![Fluent Theme](images/fluent-lightdark.jpg \"Fluent Theme\") _New Fluent theme, available in light and dark variants, with multiple color choices_  \n\n![Updated Themes](images/themes1.png \"Updated Themes\") _Latest Orchis, Mojave, and WhiteSur themes improve appearance for Raven widgets_\n\n#### Budgie Welcome\n\nOur welcome app is automatically updated for all 22.04 & 23.04 and 23.10 users\n\n1. Welcome has been moved to core22 - this allows us compatibility with future versions of ubuntu and to reduce our ISO size.\n2. Tweaks to the dropbox screenshot size and the message when installing Flatpaks has been made\n3. Nemo Dropbox installation has been tweaked to be more seamless\n4. New Fluent make-over is available\n\n#### Additional\n\n1. Really nice changes made by the slick-greeter project have been captured on a fresh package by team-member Sam [https://github.com/UbuntuBudgie/slick-greeter/blob/debian/debian/changelog](https://github.com/UbuntuBudgie/slick-greeter/blob/debian/debian/changelog)\n2. Likewise the graphical interface for slick called lightdm-settings I have repackaged and uploaded to Ubuntu/mantic\n\n![Slick Greeter](images/slick-greeter.png \"Slick Greeter\") _Slick Greeter now allows toggling the password visibility_\n\n### Areas to look out for\n\nN/A\n\n## Upgrading from previous releases\n\nIt is important to keep in mind a few useful tips before attempting a release upgrade:\n\n- Backup your data.\n- Install all available updates and reboot.\n- It is always a good idea to run either a full system snapshot with Timeshift, to a secondary drive, or a full system image using Clonezilla.\n- If you have PPAs that come with updated kernel, mesa, GPU drivers, it is better to purge those PPAs and reboot before attempting release upgrade.\n- Once release upgrade starts, all your PPAs will be disabled. If you rely on important software from PPAs, it is better to manually check if those are updated for upcoming release of Ubuntu.\n- After upgrade is completed, remember to go to software sources, change release name on your PPAs, enable them and refresh package cache.\n\n### Scheduled upgrade from 22.04 LTS\n\nUsers of Ubuntu Budgie 22.04 LTS will not be prompted to upgrade to 23.10 automatically. Remember the upgrade path for most LTS users is from LTS to LTS i.e. 22.04 to 24.04. LTS versions are focused on stability.\n\n### Manual upgrade from 22.04 to 23.10\n\nThere is no direct route to upgrade to 23.10 to 22.04. You must first upgrade to 22.10, followed by 23.04 before upgrading to 23.10.\n\nPlease read the 22.10 [release notes](https://ubuntubudgie.org/2022/09/ubuntu-budgie-22-10-release-notes/) for this procedure.\n\n### Upgrade from 23.04 to 23.10\n\nIMPORTANT: remember to double-check you have the following vital package before you upgrade:\n\n```\nsudo apt install ubuntu-budgie-desktop\n```\n\nA few days/week or two after the formal release of 23.10 in October you will be automatically offered a graphical prompt to upgrade.\n\nAlternatively, from a command line run:\n\n```\nupdate-manager\n```\n\nSome of the packages that were installed as part of the Ubuntu Budgie backports PPA (ppa:ubuntubudgie/backports) will be uninstalled as part of the upgrade. Use budgie-welcome to reinstall anything that is removed.\n\nPlease refer to the community wiki for more help:\n\n[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Upgrades](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Upgrades)\n\nAlso, Ask Ubuntu has an excellent guide to help you upgrade:\n\n[http://askubuntu.com/questions/110477/how-do-i-upgrade-to-a-newer-version-of-ubuntu](http://askubuntu.com/questions/110477/how-do-i-upgrade-to-a-newer-version-of-ubuntu)\n\n## Where to download the Ubuntu Budgie final release\n\n![Budgie Installer](images/installer.jpg \"Budgie Installer\") _Ubuntu Budgie's brand new installer_\n\nUbuntu Budgie for 23.10 has two ISOs to download from.\n\nThe first uses Ubuntu Budgie's brand new installer built upon the solid desktop installer from Canonical.\n\n- it is strongly recommended that you run `snap refresh ubuntu-budgie-installer` to get the very latest installer update.\n\nThe second ISO uses the traditional but legacy\"Ubiquity\" installer. This will be discontinued from future Ubuntu Budgie releases. This legacy installer should be used if the new installer has an issue that prevents successful installation.\n\nLinks to download final releases, as well as installation instructions, will be available on our Ubuntu Budgie website once Final Release is built: [https://ubuntubudgie.org/downloads/](https://ubuntubudgie.org/downloads/).\n\n## Known Issues\n\n- For more generic issues with Ubuntu 23.10, please check this link: [Ubuntu 23.10 Release Notes](https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/mantic-minotaur-release-notes/35534).\n- We recommend that you install Ubuntu Budgie on hardware - suggested configuration is 4GB or more RAM and a newer than 10 year computer with 40GB disk space or more. UB can be installed in a virtual machine; we recommend you use 3D host graphics with 128Mb virtual graphics memory and 4GB RAM or more plus 40GB virtual disk space.

To quickly summarize for those that did not catch our blog post on planned \u003Ca href=\"https://buddiesofbudgie.org/blog/wayland\">Wayland support\u003C/a> and may not be familiar with Magpie, as well as to offer a bit of a history lesson, we will quickly go over the important parts.Historically, Budgie Desktop has used GNOME’s \u003Ca href=\"https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/mutter\">Mutter\u003C/a> window manager (nowadays Mutter is also a Wayland compositor) to do the heavy lifting for \u003Ccode>budgie-wm\u003C/code>. budgie-wm has served as a small layer on top of Mutter, handling select keybindings for Budgie-specific functionality, input management, animations, screenshot management, backgrounds, and so forth. With every GNOME Stack release, Mutter ABI would change and Budgie Desktop would need to be updated to support the latest ABI and typically two or three ABIs prior so those on older GNOME stacks could still get newer Budgie Desktop releases. On many occasions, this resulted in significant pressure on the team as late ABI changes would land and we would need to work quickly to adapt to them.As GNOME has pursued improvements around their Wayland support, this has understandably at times resulted in regressions in its support for X11. As Budgie Desktop currently uses X11, this has created a less optimal user experience for our users. This reached a turning point with GNOME 44 / mutter-12 ABI when there was a larger split between Wayland and X11 support in Mutter, resulting in many regressions in its X11 support that to this day remain unresolved.During our team discussions, we came to the conclusion that we wanted to address this in two manners:\u003C/p>\n\u003Col>\n\u003Cli>Restore X11 support / functionality expected by our users for the immediate future.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Prioritize adoption of Wayland, a longer-term goal, by developing a wlroots-based compositor that would serve as our window manager for both future Budgie 10.x releases when we go Wayland-only, as well as Budgie 11.\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ol>\n\u003Cp>To accomplish these goals, we first decided to soft-fork Mutter at the state it was in for GNOME 43, eliminating the regressions introduced in GNOME 44 / mutter-12. This version of Magpie is &#x3C; 1.0 (e.g. 0.9.x) and is designed to be a temporary fork catered to Budgie and its current X11-only support. Alongside this effort, we are building “Magpie 1.0” as the wlroots-based Wayland compositor, with the plan to \u003Cstrong>fully drop X11 support once Magpie 1.0 is ready for consumption\u003C/strong>. In the case of Budgie 10.8, this series \u003Ca href=\"https://github.com/BuddiesOfBudgie/budgie-desktop/pull/387\">supports magpie-0 ABI\u003C/a>, which is effectively identical to the mutter-12 ABI. This provides us a stable ABI that can be leveraged across multiple GNOME Stack releases until Magpie 1.0 is released. Magpie v0.x should be used for GNOME 44+ and we will not be pursuing support for newer mutter ABIs, such as mutter-13 ABI for GNOME 45, as this would not be the most optimal use of our engineering bandwidth over development efforts around Wayland and Budgie 11.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch4 id=\"privilege-escalation-dialog-improvements\">Privilege Escalation Dialog Improvements\u003C/h4>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg __ASTRO_IMAGE_=\"{&#x22;src&#x22;:&#x22;images/image&#x22;,&#x22;alt&#x22;:&#x22;|1920x1080&#x22;,&#x22;index&#x22;:1}\"> \u003Cem>Polkit Dialogs now provide an action description\u003C/em>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Wonder what is prompting that PolicyKit authentication dialog?

As we elaborated on in our \u003Ca href=\"https://buddiesofbudgie.org/blog/wayland\">Wayland\u003C/a> blog post, historically we have used either \u003Ccode>na-tray\u003C/code> or the XEmbed Protocol for the creation, management, and rendering of trays icons. This had notable downsides, such as:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>Icons not scaling with panel size\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>High DPI scaling relied on the application providing the icon to support DPI scaling\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Inconsistent styling of tray menus\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Relies on X11 APIs, which is not viable for our Wayland-only future\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ul>\n\u003Cp>For Budgie 10.8, our System Tray has adopted the \u003Ca href=\"https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Specifications/StatusNotifierItem/\">Status Notifier\u003C/a> specification. This is a modern, vendor-agnostic solution that enables applications to communicate all relevant information for the rendering of their tray icon over DBus rather than being responsible for drawing tray icons and menus themselves, promoting the development of catered solutions by desktop environments and those developing panels for user experiences such as tiling window managers.The result of this on the Budgie Desktop side is that we can draw all menus and items in a manner that is visually consistent. Going into Budgie 11, we will have a similar solution and paired with multiple panels across multiple monitors (a requirement for Budgie 11), you will even be able to have multiple tray applet instances enabled, which was not otherwise possible with the XEmbed-based solutions.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch4 id=\"general-improvements\">General Improvements\u003C/h4>\n\u003Cp>Budgie 10.8 features a bunch of smaller improvements, complementing our major new features and changes.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch5 id=\"budgie-menu\">Budgie Menu\u003C/h5>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg __ASTRO_IMAGE_=\"{&#x22;src&#x22;:&#x22;images/budgiemenu-1.png&#x22;,&#x22;alt&#x22;:&#x22;Budgie Menu&#x22;,&#x22;title&#x22;:&#x22;Budgie Menu&#x22;,&#x22;index&#x22;:0}\"> \u003Cem>The upstream budgie menu is available to be added to your panel via budgie desktop settings.\u003C/em>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cem>The following enhancements and changes have been made by upstream to this upstream applet.\u003C/em>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Our Application Indexer’s fuzzy scoring function \u003Ca href=\"https://github.com/BuddiesOfBudgie/budgie-desktop/pull/385\">has been ported to C\u003C/a>.

Porting it to C fixed the crashing issue while still producing the desired search results.For Budgie Menu, we \u003Ca href=\"https://github.com/BuddiesOfBudgie/budgie-desktop/pull/388\">made changes\u003C/a> to the organization of some applications based on user feedback. Applications that previously were put into the Other category ended up fitting better in other existing categories and some application exclusions no longer making sense either. The Utilities category has been removed entirely, as we found it had considerable overlap with the System Tools category and it was not immediately clear what the difference was between Accessories and Utilities.

When Budgie Desktop development began under Buddies of Budgie, the decision was made early on to move to our adopted light green primary color. This was chosen to be more like greenery and common (green) budgerigars. The first to be updated was the Budgie logo itself and the color has finally made its way to our default internal theme as well.Alongside this change, we have darkened some elements such as Budgie Menu, the panel, and Raven’s background.

Lots of updated translations from our brilliant translators [https://www.transifex.com/ubuntu-budgie/](https://www.transifex.com/ubuntu-budgie/)\n2. bug-fix - wallstreet accepts custom folder with spaces\n3. Traditional layout now reflects the default 'v10.7' layout upstream - use budgie welcome to apply this layout (see below)\n4. Clockworks applet - clocks can now vary by up to 24hrs\n5. Weather Applet Icons have been reworked to work better against both light and dark themes\n\n![file](images/image-1681235209469.png)\n\n![file](images/image-1681235233596.png)\n\n4. Fix for ShowTime, Weather applet disappearing from the desktop after logon\n5. Weather applet now allows searching by locale characters i.e. not just plain ascii\n6. Both screenshot applet and haste applet have now been [archived](https://discourse.ubuntubudgie.org/t/testing-23-04-are-you-brave-enough/6380/9?u=fossfreedom) by its author and as such we have removed the ability to install these applets.\n7. Ubuntu Budgie developer, Sam, has updated his personal project budgie-analogue-applet. This now displays correctly when fractional scaling is used. In addition, the clock is available as a Raven widget to be added.\n\n![file](images/image-1681235259705.png)\n\n8. Ubuntu Budgie dev Jacob has [improved hotcorners](https://ubuntubudgie.org/2023/02/new-hotcorners-feature-introduced-in-23-04/)\n\n![file](images/image-1681235281186.png)\n\n- Hotspot areas are now extended to 8 spots (all edges & corners)\n- The settings interface now has a dedicated window. The applet is still available for quick access to hotcorner settings, but is optional.\n\n![](images/hcapplet-744x252.png)\n\n- The options to set pressure and/or delay no longer exclude each other, so the user can fine tune his or her own touch to prevent unintended firing.\n- Hotcorners now has another built-in feature to prevent unintended firing. When for example text is selected and we unavoidably hit the edge of the screen, the corresponding command could be triggered. Hotcorners therefore checks for mouse button 1 to be pressed, skips action if that is the case.\n\n9. [Window Shuffler](https://ubuntubudgie.org/2023/01/new-edge-tiling-introduced-in-23-04/) has undergone a dramatic rework by Jacob. Now available is quarter tiling both keyboard and using a mouse via a feature we call Drag Snap\n\n![](images/dragsnap_default-744x95.png) Quarter & half tiling is pretty much self-explaining. Dragging a window to the top of the screen will tile the window to top half, but keeping the mouse button pressed will progress the action into full screen tiling.\n\nAlso available is asymmetric tiling by pressing Alt or Ctrl whilst dragging\n\n- Alt + drag will tile the window into 3/5 of the screen width\n- Control + drag will tile the window into 2/5 of the screen width\n\n10. From the BuddiesOfBudgie team member EbonJaeger is a new applet that replaces the new default user indictor with a more traditional looking applet\n\n![file](images/image-1681235354892.png)\n\n11. VisualSpace applet has now an option in Budgie Desktop Settings to reverse the icon scroll direction to switch between workspaces\n12. The Brightness applet no longer resets the night-light setting/colour if it is active when the brightness popover is shown.\n13. Wallstreet images are now displayed in alphabetical order rather than in file-system order.\n14. A fix to the application indicators to display more chrome based icons has been made\n15. QuickNote now includes a copy button and a paste button. These perform the same as CTRL+C and CTRL+V in quicknote - quick GUI based method for copy/paste.\n\n![QuickNote](images/quicknote-1.png \"QuickNote\") _New copy/paste buttons in QuickNote_\n\n16. QuickNote buttons have gained a tooltip to improved understanding\n17. Budgie Desktop has removed the legacy xembed based system tray in favour of the Status Notifier applet. There are a number of very old legacy apps still in the archive that use the old panel icons. Ubuntu Budgie have made an optional applet called Budgie Carbon Tray Applet that provides support for these legacy apps. This applet will be dropped in future Ubuntu Budgie releases that will be based on Wayland.\n\n![file](images/image-1695149064732.png) _Carbon Tray Applet supports legacy XEMBED tray apps_\n\n18. The network applet now supports bluetooth tethering for network access - i.e. use your phone to be used to access the internet. So you should see your phone in the list of networks. Use budgie-control-center - networks / bluetooth to manage these connections\n19. a new applet called Media Player applet is available from an inspiring independent developer through budgie welcome. This is an alternative to those that want to control media via the panel rather than raven.\n\n![file](images/image-1713298250864.png)\n\n## Budgie Control Center\n\nWe have uploaded a brand new budgie-control-center - this incorporates dozens of enhancements and bug fixes that have been pulled together\n\nChangelog here [https://github.com/BuddiesOfBudgie/budgie-control-center/releases/tag/v1.3.0](https://github.com/BuddiesOfBudgie/budgie-control-center/releases/tag/v1.3.0)\n\n1. Screen sharing capabilities in BCC have been removed due to upstream GNOME changes that are incompatible with BCC.\n2. Fractional scaling support has been enhanced.\n3. Lots of wacom support updates made in BCC\n4. color profile support in BCC reworked and only supported if the monitor used itself supports color-profiles\n5. BCC Displays show the monitor refresh rate\n\n## Budgie Desktop\n\nWe are pleased to include the very latest budgie desktop version in 24.04. This is a really great release!\n\n1. Applets can now be globally spaced rather than needing individual spacers ![file](images/image-1664392188931.png)\n2. Refinements to the workspace applet\n3. Clock applet no longer displays a link to a calendar application\n4. Complete reworking of the Budgie in-built theme\n5. Icon-tasklist applet no longer supports non-grouping of apps\n6. Raven now has a full API allowing third-party developers to create new widgets for it. We look forward to seeing how developers make use of this in the future.\n7. The Media Player widget now has a more compact design.\n8. You can now click on the widget header icons for sound output and input to mute the respective device.\n9. You can now turn off day names in the Calendar widget.\n10. There is now a new Raven widget called Usage Monitor. This is a minimalistic widget that displays CPU, RAM, and Swap usage.\n11. Notifications are now sorted oldest to newest.\n12. New Power Dialog for common actions such as shutdown, reboot, suspend, and more. This functionality replaces the actions exposed through the User Indicator applet, no longer requiring it to be added to the panel. The User Indicator will now invoke the Power Dialog and the new button in Budgie Menu will do the same!\n13. Budgie Desktop now includes a native screenshot capability - look for the icon in the menu - or just press print screen / alt print screen etc etc. ![file](images/image-1665774091522.png) ![file](images/image-1665774120897.png)\n14. IBUS handling (if ibus is installed) has been revamped to resolve the wrong keyboard layout on logon.\n15. New upstream budgie-menu (traditional layout) with places, control-center and settings access buttons. The Utilities category has been removed entirely, since it had considerable overlap with the System Tools category and it was not immediately clear what the difference was between Accessories and Utilities. Now, applications previously in Utilities can be found in the System Tools category.\n\n![file](images/image-1664392472085.png)\n\n2. Budgie Desktop also has received improvements _(the alternative menu available to be added to your panel)_,\n    \n3. There is the adoption of StatusNotifier support in System Tray _(an alternative to the application indicator that can be added to your panel)_, This native budgie system tray (like Ubuntus app indicator) resolves\n    \n    - Icons not scaling with panel size\n    - High DPI scaling relied on the application providing the icon to support DPI scaling\n    - Inconsistent styling of tray menus\n4. We know however there are still legacy apps that require the old system tray. We have budgie-carbon-tray-applet available in our budgie-extras PPA for these types of apps.\n    \n5. Budgie Window manager is now called Magpie which is a soft-fork Mutter at the state it was in for GNOME 43; this has eliminated the regressions introduced in GNOME 44 and later. Note: Later versions of Budgie Desktop will be Wayland only. The release for 24.04 is X11 based only.\n    \n6. Budgie 10.9 switches to using budgie-session; this is a \"softish fork of gnome-session, designed to provide a stable session manager for Budgie 10.x\".\n    \n\n#### Redesigned Bluetooth applet\n\nBudgie 10.9 features a redesigned Bluetooth applet. This applet now provides direct (dis-)connect functionality for paired Bluetooth devices, battery life indicators, as well as functionality for sending files to Bluetooth devices.\n\n#### Budgie Trash Applet\n\n![|1920x1080](images/image) _Budgie Trash applet allows easy access to the trash folder_\n\nThe previously third-party Budgie Trash Applet, developed by Buddies of Budgie team member Evan Maddock, has been merged into mainline Budgie Desktop to become a part of the default applets available to users out-of-the-box. This trash applet enables the user to quickly access and empty the contents of their trashcan as well as restore files.\n\n#### Privilege Escalation Dialog Improvements\n\n![|1920x1080](images/image) _Polkit Dialogs now provide an action description_\n\n#### Performance / Power Modes In Battery Status Applet\n\n![|1920x1080](images/image) _Quickly switch between different power profile modes_\n\nBudgie's battery indicator in the Status applet now provides the ability to control the Performance / Power profile modes offered by [power-profiles-daemon](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/hadess/power-profiles-daemon?ref=buddiesofbudgie.org). When available on a supported system, you will get access to various options such as:\n\n- Balanced\n- Power Saver\n- Performance\n\n#### Internal Theme Refinements\n\n![Internal Theme](images/budgie-internal-theme.jpg \"Internal Theme\") _The internal theme now features a green accent color, and better contrast_\n\nWe have made some small refinements and recoloring to our internal theme. Historically, the primary accent color in our internal theme mirrored that of the Solus blue. When Budgie Desktop development began under Buddies of Budgie, the decision was made early on to move to our adopted light green primary color. This was chosen to be more like greenery and common (green) budgerigars. The first to be updated was the Budgie logo itself and the color has finally made its way to our default internal theme as well.Alongside this change, we have darkened some elements such as Budgie Menu, the panel, and Raven's background. Raven widgets, text, and iconography should contrast better against the darker background as a result!\n\n#### Other Small Things\n\n- Kvantum and Murrine themes are now hidden in Budgie Desktop Settings [#393](https://github.com/BuddiesOfBudgie/budgie-desktop/pull/393)\n- We have moved the battery label setting to Budgie Desktop Settings as well as moved the percentage label from left of icon to right [#389](https://github.com/BuddiesOfBudgie/budgie-desktop/pull/389)\n\n#### Bug Fixes\n\nIt would not be a Budgie release without some bug squashing. In this release, we have:\n\n- Enabled ellipsize for Style boxes in BDS [#403](https://github.com/BuddiesOfBudgie/budgie-desktop/pull/403)\n- Fixed Icon Tasklist not showing Private Internet Access [#379](https://github.com/BuddiesOfBudgie/budgie-desktop/pull/379)\n- Fixed Polkit dialog resizing\n- Prevented notifications and screenshot from locking up when sink is locked\n\n## Raspberry Pi\n\nDue to the extraordinary changes in 24.04 we have run out of time to produce a raspi image on the 24.04 release day. We'll be looking more closely at the development of our raspi image in due course and a separate announcement will be made.\n\n## Budgie Welcome\n\nOur welcome app is automatically updated for all 22.04 & 23.10 users\n\n1. Lots of updated translations from our brilliant translators [https://www.transifex.com/ubuntu-budgie/](https://www.transifex.com/ubuntu-budgie/)\n2. Our Backports is now complete - testing of budgie-welcome recommendations/themes and applets/getting started is needed.\n3. Menu Option and welcome page changed from \"Budgie Themes & Layouts\" to \"Budgie Makeovers & Layouts\" to present a more accurate overview of the capability.\n4. The front page icons now are fixed rather than trying to be translated. This prevents locale characters such as chinese being displayed.\n5. Mysteriously Chromium Browser disappeared as an option for the browser ballot. This now has been resolved.\n6. Welcome has been moved to core22 - this allows us compatibility with future versions of ubuntu and to reduce our ISO size.\n7. Tweaks to the dropbox screenshot size and the message when installing Flatpaks has been made\n8. Nemo Dropbox installation has been tweaked to be more seamless\n9. New Fluent make-over is available\n10. New Colloid make-over is available\n11. getting started. The information about your NVME drives should now be displayed.\n12. gaming - corectrl. This now installs corectrl from the universe package rather than from a PPA.\n13. our mastodon instance is now accessible from the front-page\n14. our matrix community channel is now accessible from the front-page\n15. Gaming page now ensures Steam successfully installs in Ubuntu Budgie without extra \"386 repository\" tweaks.\n\n## Themes\n\n![Updated Themes](images/themes1.png \"Updated Themes\") _Latest Orchis, Mojave, and WhiteSur themes improve appearance for Raven widgets_\n\n1. Orchis Gtk Theme has been update to the latest upstream version. Note - upstream has changed its name convention for each variant & colour. So on an upgrade you have to manually change your theme name when you re-add the backports PPA\n2. Pocillo Gtk Theme has the following fixes: fixes for styling mate-system-monitor fixes for styling atril pdf reader fixes for styling mate-calculator fix for chrome and chromium showing the background in a 1px wide divider\n3. Latest Pocillo Icons derived from Qogir & Tela icons\n4. Latest QogirBudgie theme derived from Qogir upstream. The Dark and Light theme variants have been renamed slightly (capitalised). Thus on an upgrade these themes will need to be applied via budgie desktop settings\n5. Latest upstream Mojave Gtk Theme\n6. Latest upstream WhiteSur Gtk Theme\n7. Latest upstream WhiteSur Icon Theme\n8. Latest upstream Vimix Gtk Theme\n9. Latest upstream Tela Circle Theme\n10. Latest WhiteSur gtk theme is now available\n11. Brand new Fluent based makeover is now available\n\n![Fluent Theme](images/fluent-lightdark.jpg \"Fluent Theme\") _New Fluent theme, available in light and dark variants, with multiple color choices_  \n\n12. Latest McMojave-circle icon theme is now available\n13. A new Colloid makeover is now available - colloid gtk theme + colloid icons and ubuntu fonts/cursors\n\n![file](images/image-1713298323333.png)\n\n## Additional\n\n1. Pulseaudio is no longer our default audiostack. Pipewire is now the default. The package `pulseaudio` can safely be purged.\n2. Really nice changes made by the slick-greeter project have been captured on a fresh package by team-member Sam [https://github.com/UbuntuBudgie/slick-greeter/blob/debian/debian/changelog](https://github.com/UbuntuBudgie/slick-greeter/blob/debian/debian/changelog)\n3. Slick Greeter now allows toggling the password visibility\n\n## Areas to look out for\n\n1. Our default applications have been revamped - This is described fully in this post [https://discourse.ubuntubudgie.org/t/default-applications-review-for-22-10-23-04-and-beyond/5883?u=fossfreedom](https://discourse.ubuntubudgie.org/t/default-applications-review-for-22-10-23-04-and-beyond/5883?u=fossfreedom) and outlined here:\n    \n    - GNOME-Calculator → Mate Calc\n    - GNOME-Calendar → dropped from the install\n    - GNOME-Maps → dropped from the install\n    - GNOME System Monitor → Mate System Monitor\n    - Evince → Atril\n    - File Roller aka GNOME Archive Manager → new look due to switch to GTK4\n    - GNOME Screenshot → dropped from the install\n    - GEdit text editor\n    - GNOME Font Viewer → font-manager\n    - Cheese → guvcview\n    - Celluloid → Parole\n    - Rhythmbox → Lollypop + Goodvibes + gpodder\n    - App-Center replaces GNOME-Software\n2. We now have webp image support out-of-the-box\n    \n3. The plymouth theme (the image that is displayed during boot up-to the login manager) has been revamped.\n    \n\nThis now is a spinner based theme. For machines that boot with the manufacturer image, you will see that image up-to the login screen.\n\n4. Canonical have also been working through the problems of the plymouth themes disappearing/reappearing due to extraneous messages on the boot console. We now see a more seamless boot image experience.\n5. Canonical have switched thunderbird to a snap. This ensures faster updates directly from Mozilla including new versions of thunderbird in the future.\n6. Our default terminal font is now Noto Mono Bold size 11.\n\nWe have changed the font due to changes made by Canonical in Lunar with the Ubuntu Mono font we previously used for many year which we do not feel work for our distro.\n\n7. The following issue we have noted with budgie related components:\n    - window shuffler crashes on ubuntu - [wayland session](https://github.com/UbuntuBudgie/budgie-extras/issues/446)\n    - on QEMU/KVM and possibly VirtualBox, adjusting the screen-resolution via budgie-control-center followed by reopening budgie-control-center crashes the whole desktop. Resetting the last-panel dconf key for budgie-control-center will allow budgie-control-center to be reopened again.\n8. The following snap issue that impact UB:\n    - installing missing theme [snaps failed](https://github.com/snapcore/snapd-desktop-integration/issues/52)\n    - touchscreen, cursor disappears to never come back unless restarting budgie-wm\n\n## Installer\n\nWe are pleased to ship with Ubuntu's brand new installer. Ubuntu Budgie was the first flavour that shipped with the installer in 23.10 and have actively help to make this a first class replacement for the old Ubiquity installer. It has fantastic new graphics, clean looks and new capabilities.\n\n![file](images/image-1713297928899.png)\n\nDo look out for the ability to use subiquity based auto-install scripts. Active Directory support is also available via an installer option. Do note for the 24.04 release\n\n- slick greeter needs to be switched to manual login via the login settings app or by including in `/etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf` the line `greeter-show-manual-login=true`\n- Switch to a TTY before first login and run `sudo pam-auth-update --enable mkhomedir` to ensure the home folder is created\n\n## Upgrading from previous releases\n\nIt is important to keep in mind a few useful tips before attempting a release upgrade:\n\nIMPORTANT: remember to double-check you have the following vital package before you upgrade:\n\n```\nsudo apt install ubuntu-budgie-desktop\n```\n\n- Backup your data.\n- Install all available updates and reboot.\n- It is always a good idea to run either a full system snapshot with Timeshift, to a secondary drive, or a full system image using Clonezilla.\n- If you have PPAs that come with updated kernel, mesa, GPU drivers, it is better to purge those PPAs and reboot before attempting release upgrade.\n- Once release upgrade starts, all your PPAs will be disabled. If you rely on important software from PPAs, it is better to manually check if those are updated for upcoming release of Ubuntu.\n- After upgrade is completed, remember to go to software sources, change release name on your PPAs, enable them and refresh package cache.\n\n### Scheduled upgrade from 22.04 LTS\n\nUsers of Ubuntu Budgie 22.04 LTS will not be prompted to upgrade to 24.04 automatically. Remember the upgrade path for most LTS users is from LTS to LTS i.e. 22.04 to 24.04.1 due in August this year. LTS versions are focused on stability.\n\n### Manual upgrade from 22.04\n\nAfter the release of 24.04, ensure you change your Software Sources to offer updates for any version:\n\n[![](images/wp_editor_md_34f6ab29d9728ad3e078317aaafffcc0.jpg)](https://ubuntubudgie.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/wp_editor_md_34f6ab29d9728ad3e078317aaafffcc0.jpg)\n\nYou will then be offered to upgrade when you run Software & Updates.\n\nPlease refer to the community wiki for more help:\n\n[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Upgrades](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Upgrades)\n\nAlso, Ask Ubuntu has an excellent guide to help you upgrade:\n\n[http://askubuntu.com/questions/110477/how-do-i-upgrade-to-a-newer-version-of-ubuntu](http://askubuntu.com/questions/110477/how-do-i-upgrade-to-a-newer-version-of-ubuntu)\n\n- For more generic issues with Ubuntu 23.10, please check this link: [Ubuntu 23.10 Release Notes](https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/mantic-minotaur-release-notes/35534).\n- We recommend that you install Ubuntu Budgie on hardware - suggested configuration is 4GB or more RAM and a newer than 10 year computer with 40GB disk space or more. UB can be installed in a virtual machine; we recommend you use 3D host graphics with 128Mb virtual graphics memory and 4GB RAM or more plus 40GB virtual disk space. Running with defaults on most virtualisation systems often results in a broken experience with crashes when launching budgie-control-center, applications such as Microsoft Edge failing to run because of the lack of a graphics card, choppy youtube experience etc.\n\n## On-going support\n\nAs an official community flavour we will be supporting the distro for three years. This support includes releasing important stability issues as well as critical security fixes directly affecting our distro.\n\nBudgie packages are primarily in the Universe repository where the community help maintain this software.\n\nCommunity Support is available via our discourse forum. Ask Ubuntu and Ubuntu forums can and should also be used for all Ubuntu matters - all flavours are Ubuntu!\n\nCanonical have also stated that they will support all packages with critical security related issues in the main and universe repositories for twelve years via a Ubuntu Pro subscription. Remember this is free for Ubuntu members - so get involved and this can be one of the many rewards for actively participating in Ubuntu.\n\n## Where to download Ubuntu Budgie daily builds and final releases\n\n### Daily and Beta builds\n\nUbuntu Budgie daily builds for AMD64 architecture are available here: [http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-budgie/daily-live/current/](http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-budgie/daily-live/current/)\n\n### Final Releases\n\nLinks to download final releases, as well as installation instructions, will be available on our Ubuntu Budgie website once Final Release is built: [https://ubuntubudgie.org/downloads/](https://ubuntubudgie.org/downloads/).\n\n## Known Issues\n\n- For more generic issues with Ubuntu 24.04, please check this link: [Ubuntu 24.04 Release Notes](https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/noble-numbat-release-notes/39890).\n\n## Infrastructure Sponsors\n\nWe just wanted to thank our infrastructure sponsors who help us keep the lights on.\n\n### Digital Ocean\n\nOn a mission to simplify cloud computing so developers and their teams can spend more time building software that changes the world.\n\n### Discourse\n\nDiscourse is the 100% open source discussion platform built for the next decade of the Internet.

This was chosen to be more like greenery and common (green) budgerigars. The first to be updated was the Budgie logo itself and the color has finally made its way to our default internal theme as well.Alongside this change, we have darkened some elements such as Budgie Menu, the panel, and Raven’s background.

We have been working closely with our fellow Buddies Of Budgie maintainers.  \nExcellent progress has been made towards this huge effort - internally we already have a Wayland based distro that we are 'dog-fooding'. We will share more information once we have a more stable offering.\n\n## Applets and mini-apps\n\n1. Lots of updated translations from our brilliant translators [https://www.transifex.com/ubuntu-budgie/](https://www.transifex.com/ubuntu-budgie/)\n2. The third-party applet budgie-sysmonitor-applet has received a number of new sensors and changes (v0.10.2). This has been backported to noble as well.\n\n## Budgie Desktop\n\n[![This image shows Ubuntu Budgie desktop with system information screen open.](images/Screenshot-from-2024-10-09-14-30-24-744x311.png)](https://ubuntubudgie.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Screenshot-from-2024-10-09-14-30-24.png)\n\n1. The latest budgie-desktop v10.9.2 forms the basis of our Oracular offering. summary of the upstream [notes](https://buddiesofbudgie.org/blog/budgie-10-9-2-released)\n\n- Budgie Menu: The upstream budgie menu will now show applications which report as being Terminal-based (e.g. `Terminal=true` in their desktop file). Users of applications like Neovim rejoice!\n- Budgie Run Dialog: Fixed a regression where our setting of skip pager and taskbar was not being called during construction, which resulted in it showing up in our task switchers (IconTasklist and Task List).\n- Dialogs: Fixed end session dialogs blocking authentication dialogs.\n- Notifications: Fixed an issue where a notification's default action would be performed when the close button was clicked.\n- Specification Compliance: Fixed an issue where we referred to the restart / reboot icon as \"system-restart-symbolic\" instead of \"system-reboot-symbolic\". This should improve compatibility with icon themes while retaining our own icon as a fallback in the event the icon theme does not provide it.\n- System Tray: Fixed an issue whereby some applications would not show with their intended icon. This is the result of such applications (e.g. Cinny and Tauon) being non-compliant with the [StatusNotifierItem specification](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Specifications/StatusNotifierItem/StatusNotifierItem/) by providing absolute paths to icons instead of either an icon name or icon data.\n- TabSwitcher: We will no longer show an empty switcher when there are no windows to actually switch between.\n- Workspace Applet\n    - Fixed an issue where clicking a window icon would not perform an intended workspace switch.\n    - Fixed left scroll direction. In libxfce4windowing, _our_ concept of \"left\" maps to their \"down\", but \"right\" is still \"right\".\n- build: Re-hide warnings that were previously hidden in Meson \u003C 1.4.0. In 1.4.0, it began to show warnings that are largely the result of bad C codegen in the Vala compiler, resulting in unreadable log spam and making it substantially more difficult to see actual warnings that need to be addressed.\n- vapi: update to support libxfce4windowing 4.19.3\n\n## Other Improvements and Bug Fixes\n\n[![This image showcases the change of default terminal app to xfce terminal for Ubuntu Budgie.](images/Screenshot-from-2024-10-09-14-34-46-744x311.png)](https://ubuntubudgie.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Screenshot-from-2024-10-09-14-34-46.png)\n\n1. Our default layout has been revised to ensure a smooth transition later to our wayland offering. The X11 plank dock has been dropped. We have now the budgie-desktop dock styled with our Pocillo theme. The top-bar defaults to a dark bar theme.\n    \n2. We now support the Apple image format .heif - such images can be seen through gThumb, Nemo and can be set as a wallpaper via budgie-control-center\n    \n3. We now support the Jpeg-xl format .jxl - again such images can be seen through gThumb, Nemo and can be set as a wallpaper via budgie-control-center\n    \n4. In 24.04 external deb packages were installed via gdebi. gdebi has now been dropped in favour of the updated snap-store that handles side-loading of deb packages.\n    \n5. Due to Tilix receiving very little maintenence bugs are creeping in without any resolution upstream. The project desperately needs an active maintainer. As such, we have decided to change our default terminal. We have changed from Tilix to xfce4-terminal. This is actively looked after by our xfce friends. We have slightly switched the appearance of xfce4-terminal for our distro.\n    \n6. Default wallpaper updated for oracular.\n    \n7. To celebrate 20 years of ubuntu we also sharing all the LTS backgrounds that have been tweaked and updated.\n    \n\n### Bug Fixes\n\n1. Budgie Control Center. Add picture button fails to select an image. This has been resolved by Ubuntu devs and has also been SRUd to 24.04\n\n## Budgie Welcome\n\n[![This image shows the Ubuntu Budgie desktop with Budgie Welcome app open](images/Screenshot-from-2024-10-09-14-31-26-744x311.jpg)](https://ubuntubudgie.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Screenshot-from-2024-10-09-14-31-26-scaled.jpg)\n\nOur welcome app is automatically updated for all 24.04 and 24.10 users\n\nBudgie welcome now has its oracular configuration.\n\n## Areas to look out for\n\nThe Ubuntu release notes are to be found [here](https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/oracular-oriole-release-notes/44878)\n\n## Packaging Updates\n\nWhilst not immediately obvious, various packages need to be updated for a number of reasons, so this section lists what updates have been made and this needs extra testing to confirm no regressions:\n\n1. budgie-session. Debian has split systemd into various component parts. budgie-session has been updated to correspond to this split request. This resolved build related issues.\n2. slick-greeter has received a number of refinements; v2.0.5 has been packaged by Ubuntu Budgie\n3. lightdm-settings has received a number of updates; v2.0.4 has been packaged by Ubuntu Budgie\n\n## Upgrading from previous releases\n\nIt is important to keep in mind a few useful tips before attempting a release upgrade:\n\nIMPORTANT: remember to double-check you have the following vital package before you upgrade:\n\n```\nsudo apt install ubuntu-budgie-desktop\n```\n\n- Backup your data.\n- Install all available updates and reboot.\n- It is always a good idea to run either a full system snapshot with Timeshift, to a secondary drive, or a full system image using Clonezilla.\n- If you have PPAs that come with updated kernel, mesa, GPU drivers, it is better to purge those PPAs and reboot before attempting release upgrade.\n- Once release upgrade starts, all your PPAs will be disabled. If you rely on important software from PPAs, it is better to manually check if those are updated for upcoming release of Ubuntu.\n- After upgrade is completed, remember to go to software sources, change release name on your PPAs, enable them and refresh package cache.\n\n### Scheduled upgrade from 24.04 LTS\n\nUsers of Ubuntu Budgie 24.04 LTS will not be prompted to upgrade to 24.10 automatically. Remember the upgrade path for most LTS users is from LTS to LTS i.e. 22.04 to 24.04. LTS versions are focused on stability.\n\n### Manual upgrade from 24.04\n\nAfter the release of 24.10, ensure you change your Software Sources to offer updates for any version:\n\n[![](images/wp_editor_md_34f6ab29d9728ad3e078317aaafffcc0.jpg)](https://ubuntubudgie.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/wp_editor_md_34f6ab29d9728ad3e078317aaafffcc0.jpg)\n\nYou will then be offered to upgrade when you run Software & Updates.\n\nPlease refer to the community wiki for more help:\n\n[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Upgrades](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Upgrades)\n\nAlso, Ask Ubuntu has an excellent guide to help you upgrade:\n\n[http://askubuntu.com/questions/110477/how-do-i-upgrade-to-a-newer-version-of-ubuntu](http://askubuntu.com/questions/110477/how-do-i-upgrade-to-a-newer-version-of-ubuntu)\n\n- We recommend that you install Ubuntu Budgie on hardware - suggested configuration is 4GB or more RAM and a newer than 10 year computer with 40GB disk space or more. UB can be installed in a virtual machine; we recommend you use 3D host graphics with 128Mb virtual graphics memory and 4GB RAM or more plus 40GB virtual disk space. Running with defaults on most virtualisation systems often results in a broken experience with crashes when launching budgie-control-center, applications such as Microsoft Edge failing to run because of the lack of a graphics card, choppy youtube experience etc.\n\n## On-going support\n\nAs an official community flavour we will be supporting the distro for nine months. This support includes releasing important stability issues as well as critical security fixes directly affecting our distro.\n\nBudgie packages are primarily in the Universe repository where the community help maintain this software.\n\nCommunity Support is available via our discourse forum. Ask Ubuntu and Ubuntu forums can and should also be used for all Ubuntu matters - all flavours are Ubuntu!\n\n### Final Release\n\nLinks to download final releases, as well as installation instructions, will be available on our Ubuntu Budgie website once Final Release is built: [https://ubuntubudgie.org/downloads/](https://ubuntubudgie.org/downloads/).\n\n## Known Issues\n\n- On first install and logon, using budgie-welcome to access web-based installs such as Chrome will open gedit not firefox. The workaround is to launch firefox first. Logout and login and open Budgie Welcome again\n\n## Infrastructure Sponsors\n\nWe just wanted to thank our infrastructure sponsors who help us keep the lights on.\n\n### Digital Ocean\n\nOn a mission to simplify cloud computing so developers and their teams can spend more time building software that changes the world.\n\n### Discourse\n\nDiscourse is the 100% open source discussion platform built for the next decade of the Internet.

They provide the infrastructure we need to host our website at [https://ubuntubudgie.org](https://ubuntubudgie.org) and our Discourse community forum at [https://discourse.ubuntubudgie.org](https://discourse.ubuntubudgie.org). Maybe you are familiar with them. Maybe you use them in your personal or professional life. Or maybe, like me, you didn't really see how they would benefit you.\n\nSince I don't run servers or use cloud computing professionally, I overlooked DigitalOcean. However, a few years ago, I started to create a Twitch bot for a friend. Though it was far from a critical service, I wanted a place to host it, instead of locally for several reasons:\n\n- My internet was spotty at times back then. Who wants a bot that stops working randomly.\n- Instead of having it on my home network, I could avoid possible security concerns by running it on a remote server.\n- If there are issues, I don't need to be at home to fix them.\n\nI had seen a post on Ubuntu Budgie Discourse in which Project Leader David (fossfreedom) recommended DigitalOcean to another user as a place to host bots. So I started there. I won't lie, I also tested out a few other providers, but ultimately, I chose DigitalOcean. They had a very straight-forward, intuitive website. The price was right. And they just made it so fast and easy to spin up a server. I created an Droplet - basically a Linux-based virtual machine, and put the bot on it.\n\nThe little bot server has now been up and running for almost 3 years now, without issue. I couldn't be happier with how it is working out.\n\nWhere DigitalOcean really shines though, is through its Marketplace. It has hundreds of 1-Click Droplets that you can easily create, play around with, and destroy if you are done with it. I have tried out many - PiHole, OpenVPN, and NextCloud just to name a few. All were up an running effortlessly. After creation, they have a Get Started page which walks you through any configuration that needs to be done, which is great especially for someone like me who has zero experience with any of this software.\n\nI wanted to see what it takes to get a WordPress site up and running from scratch. How much time and effort would I really need to spend? As it turns out, not much, and here is a quick look at how easy it was.\n\n![](images/digitalocean_1-744x354.png)\n\nSo I spun up a droplet, selected the OpenLiteSpeed WordPress image. I chose a few other things, such as the geographic server location and the SSH key to use.\n\n![](images/digitalocean_2-744x239.png)\n\nSeveral seconds later, my WordPress Droplet was ready to go. And once running, you can look at the Get Started page, and you will have easy-to-follow instructions to get things going. Now, this time, I didn't go through the process of registering a domain, however I have done this in the past. The process made it very easy to properly set up SSL certificates through Let's Encrypt.\n\n![](images/digitalocean_3-744x453.png)\n\nI give it a quick test.\n\n![](images/digitalocean_4-744x315.png)\n\nAnd it's up and running, in under 5 minutes of effort! Obviously, there is much more to do, to make it a usable website, but I am impressed at how easy they make it to quickly go from nothing to functional.\n\n![](images/digitalocean_5-744x621.png)\n\nWhat is also nice is that DigitalOcean does offer a free 60-day trial, up to $200 worth of credit. This makes it perfect for anyone who really just wants to play around a bit, and see what they are all about.

Please note - there is no direct upgrade path from 24.04.2 to 25.04; you must uplift to 24.10 first or perform a fresh install.\n\nIn these release notes the areas covered are:\n\n*   New features and enhancements released since 24.10\n*   Upgrading from 24.10 Ubuntu Budgie\n*   Fixed Issues\n*   Known Issues when upgrading\n*   Support arrangements for our distro\n*   Where to download Ubuntu Budgie\n\n## New Features and Enhancements\n\nThe key focus for the team for this cycle has been the conversion of our distro to a Wayland based distro. We have been working closely with our fellow Buddies Of Budgie maintainers.\n\nExcellent progress has been made towards this huge effort – we are almost there and we will be making available a 25.04 PPA specifically for our fantastic community to try and feedback. We will be shortly announcing the when-how-why in a dedicated blog post.\n\nNote - we intend to ship v10.10 of budgie-desktop as a stable release for 25.10; this will be wayland only. For 25.04 budgie-desktop is Xorg-server based and this PPA will give 25.04 users an easy way to try and give feedback - help fix issues etc.\n\nWe are no longer including Thunderbird as part of our default application set. With many users now using webmail we have decided the choice of email clients should rightly be put into our community hands - see later for the email ballot.\n\nWe now ship with bibata cursors as an option. We feel these are a great fit for our distro - just choose a bibata variant via budgie-desktop-settings.\n\n## Applets and mini-apps\n\nLots of updated translations from our brilliant translators [https://www.transifex.com/ubuntu-budgie/](https://www.transifex.com/ubuntu-budgie/) Our budgie menu applet has now the ability to show terminal based applications in the menu thanks to a pull request from a new developer Sarah Leibbrand.\n\nShow-time now correctly displays across monitors thanks to a PR from Danny Trunk.\n\nThe latest budgie-desktop v10.9.2 together with a number of fixes to resolve crashes due to the 25.04 repository archive changes forms the basis of our Plucky offering.\n\n## Other Improvements and Bug Fixes\n\nThis image showcases the change of default terminal app to xfce terminal for Ubuntu Budgie.\n\nOur default theme Pocillo has had a tidy-up thanks to new team member Kyuyrii. Likewise the Qogir theme has been updated utilising all the good work by Vinceliuice Our snap based version of Pocillo has also been updated by Kyuyrii as well together with our QogirBudgie snap theme.\n\nWe have a new snap for the icon-theme as well which will be shortly going through the approval process to allow autoconnections to other snaps.\n\nThe default wallpaper choice has been uplifted for Plucky.\n\nOur welcome app is automatically updated for all 24.04 and 24.10 users\n\nBudgie welcome now has its plucky configuration.\n\nWe now include an email ballot page - accessible via Getting Started as well as on first login after installation. Here you can choose to install evolution, geary, kontact, astroid, claws as well as the thunderbird snap.\n\n## Areas to look out for\n\nThe Ubuntu release notes are to be found [here](https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/plucky-puffin-release-notes/48687)\n\n## Packaging Updates\n\nWhilst not immediately obvious, various packages that we maintain need to be updated for a number of reasons, so this section lists what updates have been made.\n\n*   gnome-online-accounts-gtk - this is the very latest upstream version\n*   lightdm-settings\n*   slick-greeter.\n\nTeam member Sam has been busy packaging and testing the following for noble, oracular & plucky!\n\n*   colloid-icon-theme\n*   fluent-icon-theme\n*   nemo-terminal\n*   orchis-gtk-theme\n*   tela-circle-icon-theme\n*   vimix-gtk-themes\n*   whitesur-icon-theme\n*   colloid-gtk-theme\n*   mojave-gtk-theme\n*   fluent-gtk-theme\n*   whitesur-gtk-theme\n\nWe also now maintain a brand-new app called waycheck - a must for all new & existing wayland developer to see what wayland protocols are supported by your choice of wayland compositor. Do check it out.\n\n## How to install\n\nIt is important to keep in mind a few useful tips before attempting a release upgrade:\n\nIMPORTANT: remember to double-check you have the following vital package before you upgrade:\n\n```\nsudo apt install ubuntu-budgie-desktop\n```\n\n*   Backup your data.\n*   Install all available updates and reboot.\n*   It is always a good idea to run either a full system snapshot with Timeshift, to a secondary drive, or a full system image using Clonezilla.\n*   If you have PPAs that come with updated kernel, mesa, GPU drivers, it is better to purge those PPAs and reboot before attempting release upgrade.\n*   Once release upgrade starts, all your PPAs will be disabled. If you rely on important software from PPAs, it is better to manually check if those are updated for upcoming release of Ubuntu.\n*   After upgrade is completed, remember to go to software sources, change release name on your PPAs, enable them and refresh package cache.\n\n### Scheduled upgrade from 24.04 LTS\n\nUsers of Ubuntu Budgie 24.04 LTS will not be prompted to upgrade to 25.04.\n\n### Scheduled upgrade from 24.10\n\nUsers of Ubuntu Budgie 24.10 will be prompted to upgrade to 25.04 a few days/weeks after the initial release. Please be patient - Canonical only makes the switch once all the final blockers have been resolved.\n\nPlease refer to the community wiki for more help:\n\n[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Upgrades](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Upgrades)\n\nAlso, Ask Ubuntu has an excellent guide to help you upgrade:\n\n[http://askubuntu.com/questions/110477/how-do-i-upgrade-to-a-newer-version-of-ubuntu](http://askubuntu.com/questions/110477/how-do-i-upgrade-to-a-newer-version-of-ubuntu)\n\nWe recommend that you install Ubuntu Budgie on hardware – suggested configuration is 4GB or more RAM and a newer than 10 year computer with 40GB disk space or more. UB can be installed in a virtual machine; we recommend you use 3D host graphics with 128Mb virtual graphics memory and 4GB RAM or more plus 40GB virtual disk space. Running with defaults on most virtualisation systems often results in a broken experience with crashes when launching budgie-control-center, applications such as Microsoft Edge failing to run because of the lack of a graphics card, choppy youtube experience etc.\n\n## On-going support\n\nAs an official community flavour we will be supporting the distro for nine months. This support includes releasing important stability issues as well as critical security fixes directly affecting our distro.\n\nBudgie packages are primarily in the Universe repository where the community help maintain this software.\n\nCommunity Support is available via our discourse forum. Ask Ubuntu and Ubuntu forums can and should also be used for all Ubuntu matters – all flavours are Ubuntu!\n\n## Final Release\n\nLinks to download final releases, as well as installation instructions, will be available on our Ubuntu Budgie website once Final Release is built: [https://ubuntubudgie.org/downloads/](https://ubuntubudgie.org/downloads/).\n\n## Known Issues\n\n1.  Setting/changing the session language. We noticed that Menu - Language Support sometimes doesn't actually set the language for the session. The current workaround is as follows. In a terminal run\n    \n    ```\n    localectl list-locales\n    ```\n    \n    for your chosen language type\n    \n    ```\n    localectl set-locale LANG=locale.UTF-8\n    ```\n    \n    for example\n    \n    ```\n    localectl set-locale LANG=es_ES.UTF-8\n    ```\n    \n    Reboot\n    \n2.  On first install and logon, using budgie-welcome to access web-based installs such as Chrome will open gedit not firefox. The workaround is to launch firefox first. Logout and login and open Budgie Welcome again\n    \n\n## Infrastructure Sponsors\n\nWe just wanted to thank our infrastructure sponsors who help us keep the lights on.\n\n### Digital Ocean\n\nOn a mission to simplify cloud computing so developers and their teams can spend more time building software that changes the world.\n\n### Discourse\n\nDiscourse is the 100% open source discussion platform built for the next decade of the Internet.
