Ubuntu Budgie is pleased to announce our 17.10 wallpaper contest - we are looking for fabulous original images to proudly show-case our official community flavor edition of Ubuntu.

Please dig deep into your photo collection!

Your reward will be to display your work in Ubuntu - and the best of the best will be proudly displayed on our website!

So hurry - the contest is only open for approx three weeks.

[Enter the 17.10 Contest](https://www.flickr.com/groups/ubuntubudgie1710) 

Rules are available on Flickr - all photo's submitted must conform with one of the following licenses:

1. CC-BY-SA-4.0.
2. CC with Attribution v3.0 or v4.0
3. CC0 with the original authors name if its not yours

Please do not enter your photo's in other community flavor contests - there is nothing more embarrassing having the same photo being potentially included in multiple flavors!
