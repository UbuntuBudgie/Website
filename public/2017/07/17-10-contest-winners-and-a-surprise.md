Thanks to all the entrants for the contest for the 17.10 desktop wallpapers contest - there as a massive interest with loads of fantastic pictures.

So much so, we have decided - since the quality was so high - that we can also select the winners for our future 18.04 release!

It was amazingly difficult to choose - but winners there must be.

Congratulations to the winners who will have their fantastic pictures showcased in 17.10 Ubuntu Budgie:
