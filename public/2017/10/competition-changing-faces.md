t not often you get to change the face of a distro - so here is your chance.

Our default desktop, much of our website artwork has used this picture.

As we approach 18.04 (Bionic Beaver), we are offering up for you to change our default artwork. Can you do better?

Competition time - the contest closes at the end of November 2017.

We are looking for inspirational artwork - something that gives an immediate visual impact. Abstract is best - it must be recognisable when:

1. cropped as a horizontal banner,
2. scaled to a small image size 256x256
3. has application windows covering most of the picture
