**Summary**

As part of our commitment to be transparent with the community, the team is pleased to present a short statement of our financial position covering 2020 to 2021.

**History**

- Budgie Remix had launched in April 2016
- In Nov 2016 Ubuntu Budgie was granted the status as an official community flavour with Ubuntu/Canonical.
- 17.04 was our first release official release as a flavour.
- 18.04 was our first Long Term Schedule release
- 20.04 is our second Long Term Schedule release

**Goals**

As we close off our fiscal year for 2021 (Apr 2020 – Mar 31, 2021), the financial position of the project is very healthy. We have met several goals this year and including our stretch goal:

- LTS Fiscal Goal – ensure that the costs to support a three-year LTS were in place.
- Stretch Goal – ensure we have reserves to meet five years of costs (2020 – 2024).

**Operating Costs**

- Infrastructure costs relating to the website, test build servers, domain registrations
- Reserves are in place as a contingency to account for unexpected expenses.
- Two IRCCloud monthly subscriptions

**Purchases**

- Tuxedo Pulse 15 development laptop
- Raspberry Pi 4 and related equipment
- GoDaddy Domain costs

**Future Goals**

Through your contributions we have purchased development laptop which has proven invaluable to support development and support across all our supported platforms – 18.04, 19.04, 20.04, 20.10 and developing 21.04. We’ll be looking closely this year towards multimonitor development.

We have also purchased a Raspberry Pi4 with related equipment which as proven invaluable to help develop our first 21.04 Raspberry Pi Ubuntu Budgie image.

**Contributions**

- This year our community has contributed approx £5507 which is up from last year by almost approx £2250
- We have a nominal £8742 in the bank, with set-aside costs for 2020 to 2024 + reserves.

Our confidence level for our financial viability is as close to 100% as you can get.

As a comparison:

- 2016-2017, our community contributed £248.90 with no set-aside costs and no reserves
- 2017-2018, our community contributed £2460 with set-aside costs for 2018 to 2022 + reserves
- 2018-2019, our community contributed £2919 with set-aside costs for 2019 to 2023 + reserves
- 2019-2020, our community contributed £3258 with set-aside costs for 2020 to 2024 + reserves

With your help, we look forward to making more donations to developers and organisations who have helped Ubuntu Budgie.

**The Team**

All Ubuntu Budgie team members including myself are volunteers. At this point we the team do not benefit financially in anyway from your generosity. If we had one or more full-time developers, then the speed of development and improvement would be exponentially higher. For this to become fiscally possible, the project would need to grow to approx 10x the current contribution rate to achieve that.

**Canonical Support**

Although we are an official flavour of the Ubuntu Family, we do not receive any financial help from Canonical. Canonical supports Ubuntu Budgie through their launchpad build systems and ISO distribution costs.
