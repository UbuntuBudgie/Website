We are pleased to announce the release of the next version of our distro, 21.10.

This is a regular release supported for 9 months. For those looking for a longer term support release we recommend our 20.04 LTS version which is supported for 3 years.

Key highlights:

1. Release of our second Raspberry Pi image.
2. brand new budgie-desktop version – do lookout for our optional Windows 11 layout
3. Our Window Shuffler now automoves and auto-arranges windows across multimonitors and workspaces
4. Lookout for our Window Shuffler budgie applet
5. Brand new applet – budgie-cputemp-applet
6. A mass of new capabilities, changes and fixes throughout our budgie-applets
7. GNOME 40 & GNOME 41 applications

We also inherit hundreds of stability, bug-fixes and optimizations made to the underlying Ubuntu repositories. Many thanks to all the volunteers, Debian & Ubuntu maintainers and Canonical employees who have done such a sterling job packaging the changes that many more developers from all over the world have resolved.

This is the power of FOSS that we are all proud to be part of.
