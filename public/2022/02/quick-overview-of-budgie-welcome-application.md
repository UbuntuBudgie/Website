Budgie Welcome is the first thing we see when we boot a Live ISO, and after we complete our install. But do we really know what it offers? In this quick write up, I am going to walk you through all the features of this small but very useful Welcome application.

Budgie Welcome is a Snap application. There has been quite some development time on it lately. If you want to check what the team has been up to, it is very easy to jump forward to development release (edge channel), either via Software GUI, or by running this command:

```
snap refresh --edge ubuntu-budgie-welcome
```

## Let's have a look at the left side of our Budgie Welcome Application.

### Introduction and Features

Introduction and Features are a couple of very nice pages, created with the purpose of giving a new user a quick look of what this distribution has to offer.

### Getting Started

When we open Getting Started, we see a lot of very useful features. I always open this menu after a new installation of Ubuntu Budgie, so I can quickly install browsers, drivers, check options, software, and settings.

#### Browser Ballot

Most browsers are represented here. In some cases, there is even both choice of snap and regular debian package install. If some external repositories are needed to install a particular browser, a quick menu informs the user and everything is done automatically.

#### Customization

Very useful shortcuts to "Budgie Desktop Settings", where we can tweak our Budgie related settings, such as appearance, desktop, panels, and more.

There is also a shortcut to "Settings" which opens Operative system settings, such as Network, Bluetooth, Notifications, Sound, Power, Displays, Printers and more.

#### Updates and Extras

Here we can check system updates, and install Ubuntu restricted extras for codecs and other non-free media formats.

#### Drivers

A very useful page that shows us what GPU we have, if installed drivers are optimized. There is also a link to "Additional Drivers", which is useful for those that need proprietary drivers, such as NVIDIA cards.

#### Language and Input

Language and Input is great for my personal use. I type in different languages, and I also need Traditional Chinese input, which could be a bit of a hassle in some distributions. With Ubuntu Budgie, I click on the Complex Input I want, leave iBus active, and that's pretty much it. There is also a link to "Language Support" where I can check Installed Languages, and formats.

#### Optional Tasks

A few but important tasks are recommended here. Backups and Firewall are very important for everyone. I urge everyone to spend a few moments and make sure they have backups and firewall enabled. There is also a shortcut to "Configure Users", in case you need to add users to your system.

This menu will open a quick overview of your system, where you can check your distribution, kernel, Motherboard, CPU, RAM, Storage, and more.

## Conclusion

This was a quick overview of Budgie Welcome application. I have been using Ubuntu Budgie for years, and I still find this useful. I love it, and I am very proud to say that every time I show Ubuntu Budgie to a new user, they all appreciate it, especially in the first few weeks, as they get familiar with their new Operative System.

Give it a try, tell us what you think, and remember, it is all FOSS. Our code is on GitHub. If you have ideas, recommendations, or even better, you want to help, don't be shy and get in touch with us.

Last but not least, I want to take a moment to thank all the great contributors to our Budgie Welcome app. Since there is a long list and I don't want to miss anyone, please [check this link to GitHub contributors](https://github.com/UbuntuBudgie/budgie-welcome/graphs/contributors "check this link to GitHub contributors").
