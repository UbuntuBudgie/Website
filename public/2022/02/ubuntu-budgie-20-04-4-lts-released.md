We are pleased to announce the release of the next version of our distro, the fourth 20.04 LTS point release.

The LTS version is supported for 3 years while the regular releases are supported for 9 months.

The new release rolls-up various fixes and optimizations that have been released since the 20.04.3 release in July:

The kernel found in 21.10 has been backported to 20.04.4. This is part of the Hardware-Enablement-Stack release. 20.04(.1/2/3) users are automatically upgraded to the HWE (see later).

We also inherits hundreds of stability, bug-fixes and optimizations made to the underlying Ubuntu repositories. Many thanks to all the volunteers, Debian & Ubuntu maintainers and Canonical employees who have done such a sterling job packaging the changes that many more developers from all over the world have resolved. The power of FOSS that we are all proud to be part of.

## HWE

The Ubuntu LTS enablement (also called HWE or Hardware Enablement) stack provides newer kernel support for existing Ubuntu LTS releases. This enablement stack will be installed automatically as part of your regular updates if you first installed from 20.04.1/ 20.04.2 or 20.04.3.
