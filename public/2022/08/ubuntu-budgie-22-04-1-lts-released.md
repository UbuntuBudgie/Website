We are pleased to announce the release of the next version of our distro, the first 22.04 LTS point release.

The LTS version is supported for 3 years while the regular releases are supported for 9 months.

The new release rolls-up various fixes and optimizations that the Ubuntu Budgie team have been released since the 22.04 release in April:

1. Budgie Welcome updates include lots more translation update
2. various bug fixes to the core budgie-desktop
3. various bug fixes for our budgie-applets known as budgie-extras
4. GNOME Software fix to allow uninstalling of packages

We also inherits hundreds of stability, bug-fixes and optimizations made to the underlying Ubuntu repositories. Many thanks to all the volunteers, Debian & Ubuntu maintainers and Canonical employees who have done such a sterling job packaging the changes that many more developers from all over the world have resolved. The power of FOSS that we are all proud to be part of.

You can read more about 22.04 via our [Release Notes](https://ubuntubudgie.org/2022/04/ubuntu-22-04-release-notes-for-20-04-upgraders/)

[Download links](https://ubuntubudgie.org/downloads/) and installation guide are provided. As always – do check the md256sum hash value of the downloaded ISO – this really does help you get on with a flying start for your install.

Remember, upgrades to the latest version of Ubuntu are entirely free of charge.

We recommend that all users read the the Ubuntu 22.04 [Release Notes](https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/jammy-jellyfish-release-notes/24668), which document caveats and workarounds for known issues affecting all flavours including Ubuntu Budgie.

## HWE

The Ubuntu LTS enablement (also called HWE or Hardware Enablement) stack is available from the next 22.04.2 point release; it provides newer kernel support for existing Ubuntu LTS releases. This enablement stack will be installed automatically as part of your regular updates if you first installed from 22.04 or 22.04.1.
