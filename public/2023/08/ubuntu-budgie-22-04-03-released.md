We are pleased to announce the release of the next version of our distro, the third 22.04 LTS point release.

The LTS version is supported for 3 years while the regular releases are supported for 9 months.

The new release rolls-up various fixes and optimizations by Ubuntu Budgie team, that have been released since the 22.04.2 release in February:

- Budgie Welcome updates include lots more translation updates
- various bug fixes for our budgie-applets known as budgie-extras
- new version of budgie-analogue-clock-applet
- brand new fluent based makeover including fluent-gtk-theme and fluent-icon-theme
- new version of mcmojave-circle icon theme
- ability to add nemo-terminal to the file-manager
- new version of tela-circle-icon-theme
- new version of whitesur-icon-theme

We also inherit hundreds of stability, bug-fixes and optimizations made to the underlying Ubuntu repositories. Many thanks to all the volunteers, Debian & Ubuntu maintainers and Canonical employees who have done such a sterling job packaging the changes that many more developers from all over the world have resolved. The power of FOSS that we are all proud to be part of.

You can read more about 22.04 via our [Release Notes](https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/jammy-jellyfish-release-notes/24668)

Download links and installation guide are provided on our Download page. As always – please check the md256sum hash value of the downloaded ISO – this really does help you get on with a flying start for your install and reduces possible problems due to incomplete download or corrupted ISO.

Remember, upgrades to the latest version of Ubuntu are entirely free of charge.

We recommend that all users read the Ubuntu 22.04 [Release Notes](https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/jammy-jellyfish-release-notes/24668), which document caveats and workarounds for known issues affecting all flavours including Ubuntu Budgie.
