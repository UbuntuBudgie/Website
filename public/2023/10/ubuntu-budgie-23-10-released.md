We are pleased to announce the release of the next version of our distro, the 23.10 release.

This is a standard release supported for 9 months packed full of all sorts of new capabilities. If you want a well tested and longer term support then our 22.04 LTS version is supported for 3 years.

The new release has many new core updates as well as v10.8 version of budgie itself:

- The kernel is v6.5

- GNOME 45 stack with budgie's new magpie window manager

- v1.7 of our very own budgie-extras giving you a whole host of optional ways to customise your experience

- A brand new ISO utilising our very own budgie-desktop-installer. We are really pleased with this fantastic new way of installing budgie, working very closely with brilliant Canonical developers.

We also inherit hundreds of stability, bug-fixes and optimizations made to the underlying Ubuntu repositories. Many thanks to all the volunteers, Debian & Ubuntu maintainers and Canonical employees who have done such a sterling job packaging the changes that many more developers from all over the world have resolved. The power of FOSS that we are all proud to be part of.

You can read more about 23.10 via our [Release Notes](https://ubuntubudgie.org/2023/09/ubuntu-budgie-23-10-release-notes/)

[Download links](https://ubuntubudgie.org/downloads/) and installation guide are provided. As always – do check the md256sum hash value of the downloaded ISO – this really does help you get on with a flying start for your install.

Remember, upgrades to the latest version of Ubuntu are entirely free of charge.

We recommend that all users read the the Ubuntu 23.10 [Release Notes](https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/mantic-minotaur-release-notes/35534), which document caveats and workarounds for known issues affecting all flavours including Ubuntu Budgie.

As always thanks to all of the Ubuntu Budgie team together with our community - your help, devotion and support makes what Ubuntu Budgie is.
