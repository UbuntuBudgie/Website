# Introduction and Overview

We are pleased to announce the release of the next version of our distro, the fourth 22.04 LTS point release.

The LTS version is supported for 3 years while the regular releases are supported for 9 months.

# Updates and Changes

The new release rolls-up various fixes and optimizations by Ubuntu Budgie team, that have been released since the 22.04.3 release in August:

- Budgie Welcome updates include lots more translation updates
- new budgie applet called budgie-media-applet
- new budgie applet called budgie-carbon-tray-applet (primarily for budgie-desktop v10.8 and later)
- brand new colloid based makeover including colloid-gtk-theme and colloid-icon-theme
- Our gettings started - browser ballot now offers an easy way to install the Mozilla repo version of Firefox

For the adventurous among our community we have updated our backports-budgie PPA with the same version of budgie-desktop, budgie-control-center and budgie-extras applets found in our 23.10 release.

Not to be out-done, our stable Jammy release of budgie-extras has received a number of applet updates that have fixed various security related issues as well as resolving weather, previews, dropyby and wallstreet occasionally not appearing to startup on first login.  

We also inherit hundreds of stability, bug-fixes and optimizations made to the underlying Ubuntu repositories. Many thanks to all the volunteers, Debian & Ubuntu maintainers and Canonical employees who have done such a sterling job packaging the changes that many more developers from all over the world have resolved. The power of FOSS that we are all proud to be part of.

You can read more about 22.04 via our [Release Notes](https://ubuntubudgie.org/2022/04/ubuntu-22-04-release-notes-for-20-04-upgraders/)

Download links and installation guide are provided on our Download page. As always – please check the md256sum hash value of the downloaded ISO – this really does help you get on with a flying start for your install and reduces possible problems due to incomplete download or corrupted ISO.

Remember, upgrades to the latest version of Ubuntu are entirely free of charge.

We recommend that all users read the Ubuntu 22.04 [Release Notes](https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/jammy-jellyfish-release-notes/24668), which document caveats and workarounds for known issues affecting all flavours including Ubuntu Budgie.
