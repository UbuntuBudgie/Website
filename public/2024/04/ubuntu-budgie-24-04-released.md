We are pleased to announce the release of the next version of our distro, 24.04 Long Term Support.

The LTS version is supported for 3 years while the regular releases are supported for 9 months.

The new release rolls-up various fixes and optimizations that the Ubuntu Budgie team have been released since the 22.04 release in April 2022:

- Brand new installer
- New and updated applets
- Hotcorner and Window shuffler
- Very latest budgie desktop & budgie control center
- Lots of theme and icon updates to customise your experience
- Reworked Budgie Welcome for installing all things budgie, gaming and lot more
- Revamp of our default application line-up

We also inherits hundreds of stability, bug-fixes and optimizations made to the underlying Ubuntu repositories. Many thanks to all the volunteers, Debian & Ubuntu maintainers and Canonical employees who have done such a sterling job packaging the changes that many more developers from all over the world have resolved. The power of FOSS that we are all proud to be part of.

You can read more about 24.04 via our [Release Notes](https://ubuntubudgie.org/2024/04/ubuntu-budgie-24-04-release-notes/)

Download links and installation guide are provided. As always – do check the md256sum hash value of the downloaded ISO – this really does help you get on with a flying start for your install.

Remember, upgrades to the latest version of Ubuntu are entirely free of charge.

We recommend that all users read the the [Ubuntu 24.04](https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/noble-numbat-release-notes/39890) Release Notes, which document caveats and workarounds for known issues affecting all flavours including Ubuntu Budgie.
