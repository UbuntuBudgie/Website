After taking a bit of a breather over the summer holidays the team are back in full swing.

#### FUNDRAISING

![funds](images/funds.jpg)

We have had a substantial financial donation – thanks Felix!

We do need **you** to help us to remain a viable distro – so if you can afford the cost of just one of your favourite coffee in a month, please consider help us with a small donation.

Paypal is gratefully accepted – regular donors via Patreon would be great!  More details on our [Support Us](https://budgie-remix.org/support-us/) web-page.

Also we have opened a new team member opportunity – [fundraiser](https://budgie-remix.org/opportunities/).  We hope you can join.  Drop in to our [Gitter community chatroom](https://gitter.im/budgie-remix/community) to discuss.

#### 16.10 ALPHA

We put together our 16.10 alpha – many thanks for all our testers.  The feedback has been valuable.

#### ALPHA TO BETA CHANGES:

- Networking has been fixed – we now use the new Canonical Netplan configuration
- Debian Wallpapers has been removed
- The ISO can now be installed in all locales offered by the installer
- The ISO comes with English, German, French, Spanish and Portuguese for fast installation.  All other locales and languages are downloaded if required
- The 16.10 Community Contest wallpapers have been included.
- Plymouth now correctly displays “budgie-remix”
- The ISO can now be installed via Ubuntu USB Creator
- budgie-welcome has been updated to 0.3.10
- budgie-welcome now launches the Ubuntu Installer when in “live-dvd/USB” mode
- Rhythmbox defaults to the Arc dark theme – just gorgeous!
- The spurious gnome-shell session available via the login screen has been removed.

#### DEVELOPMENT

Unfortunately we have decided to drop (at least for 16.10) our change to a new greeter.  This is due to serious upstream issues affecting Debian and Ubuntu that have now (as yet) not been resolved.

We are pleased that more of the [budgie-remix packages](http://packages.ubuntu.com/search?keywords=budgie&searchon=names&suite=yakkety&section=all) have now been made available directly from the Ubuntu Universe Repos.  We are nearly there with our aim to get all of the budgie-remix packages into the Ubuntu repositories – a prerequisite for our Official Community Flavour Status application to be considered by the Ubuntu Technical Board.

#### FUTURE PLANS

We are exploring creating a new icon-theme that blends Moka with Arc themed icons – more news on this in the future hopefully … but to give you a flavour – a few Arc-coloured icons from various icon-themes and what we are currently considering for the Files folder icon.
