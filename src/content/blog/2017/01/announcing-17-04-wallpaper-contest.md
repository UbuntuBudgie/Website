Ubuntu Budgie is pleased to announce our 17.04 wallpaper contest - we are looking for fabulous original images to proudly show-case our first official community flavor edition of Ubuntu.

Please dig deep into your photo collection!

Your reward will be to display your work in Ubuntu - and the best of the best will be proudly displayed on our website!

So hurry - the contest is only open for approx three weeks.

 

[Enter the 17.04 Contest](https://www.flickr.com/groups/ubuntubudgie-1704)

 

Rules are available on Flickr - all photo's submitted must conform with one of the following licenses:

1\. CC-BY-SA-4.0. 2. CC with Attribution v3.0 or v4.0 3. CC0 with the original authors name if its not yours

Please do not enter your photo's in other community flavor contests - there is nothing more embarrassing having the same photo being potentially included in multiple flavors!
