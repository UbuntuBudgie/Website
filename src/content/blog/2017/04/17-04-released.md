e are pleased to announce the **release** of the next version of our distro - and the first as an official flavor of the **Ubuntu** family.

Based on 16.04 and 16.10 budgie-remix experiences, feedback and suggestions we have received from our users, the new release comes with a lot of **new features**, **fixes** and **optimizations**:

- Focused heavily on stability
- More customisation options via budgie welcome
- - Complete desktop look and feel change - Material Designs of Adapta or Vimix
- - Startup wizard on first logon taking new users through the first logon procedures
- - Browser ballot - we believe you should decide what your favorite browser should be
- - Overhaul of our delivered application set - the best from the GNOME family as well as the fantastic Terminix terminal emulator
- Latest upstream Budgie desktop v10.2.9
