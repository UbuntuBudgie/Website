We are pleased to announce the next point release of our budgie-remix distro based on the solid 16.04 LTS Ubuntu release.

This is our third release of the budgie-remix 16.04 series that follows Ubuntu release cycle – we have worked on getting closely aligned in the same manner as Ubuntu and the other official community flavours.

Based on 16.04.2 experiences, feedback and suggestions we have received from our users, the new release comes with a lot of new features, fixes and optimizations:

- Installation in any language – we have finally resolved how to install in any language supported by the installer
- Latest hardware enablement stack (HWE) Linux kernel 4.10
- Latest HWE Mesa and XOrg graphics
- Latest stable Budgie Desktop - v10.3.1
- Updated budgie-welcome helping you make the most of your new installation.
- budgie-welcome now is translated with many languages and locales
- Easy to use budgie-applets section to enable you to browse and easily install budgie desktop applets
- Many more theming makeover options

Have we sold you on this yet?!  We are excited – so grab the [Download ISOs or Torrents](https://ubuntubudgie.org/admin/blog/post/@page/3)  and install.

Remember if you are using 16.04 already, just keep on updating - there is no need to reinstall. You will be automatically upgraded to Ubuntu 16.04.3.
