We all use our desktop in our own unique way to suit our preferred workflow.

We also know some people need additional changes to help use their desktop more effectively.

For example visual impairment may mean there is a need for additional tweaks to contrast/sizing etc, whereas some degree of hearing loss may need some visual notifications for certain events.

**So please help the Ubuntu Budgie team to make the desktop more accessible to everyone.**

If you have a tip or trick we would like to know - for example

- additional software that you may install,
- how do you configure it,
- do you have any special bash scripts and/or configuration set-to-work to enable you or your friends & colleagues to use the desktop more effectively

Contact the team via our community channel or send us a short note via our contact us link.
