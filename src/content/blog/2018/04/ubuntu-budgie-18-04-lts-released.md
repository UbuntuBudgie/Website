We are pleased to announce the \*\*release\*\* of the next version of our distro, the third as an official flavor of the \*\*Ubuntu\*\* family and our very first LTS.

The LTS version is supported for 3 years while the regular releases are supported for 9 months.

Based on 17.10 experiences, feedback and suggestions we have received from our users, the new release comes with a lot of \*\*new features\*\*, \*\*fixes\*\* and \*\*optimizations\*\*

Here is what you can expect with the new release:

\* More customisation options via budgie welcome \* Lots more Budgie Applets available to be installed \* Dynamic Workspaces, hot-corners and Window Shuffler \* Brand new GTK+ Theme called Pocillo \* New applets as standard in the panel or available to be added via Budgie Settings

You can read more about what we have been upto via our [release notes](https://ubuntubudgie.org/blog/2018/03/08/18-04-release-notes). Upgrade instructions from both 16.04 budgie-remix and 17.10 are included. Please have a read of these since there is an extra step you need to do post-upgrade.

[**Download** links](https://ubuntubudgie.org/downloads) and installation guide are provided. As always - do check the md5sum hash value of the downloaded ISO - this really does help you get on with a flying start for your install.

If you have any questions, remember, our [forum](https://discourse.ubuntubudgie.org/) is always open and ready to help you.

\*\*Thank you all\*\* for your continued support - \*\*spread the news!\*\*

David, Ubuntu Budgie Project Leader.
