We are pleased to announce the **release** of the next version of our distro, our first LTS point release as an official flavor of the **Ubuntu** family.

The LTS version is supported for 3 years while the regular releases are supported for 9 months.

The new release rolls-up various fixes and optimizations the Ubuntu Budgie team have released since the 18.04 release in April this year:

- budgie welcome updates including new applets Desktop Weather, Advanced Brightness Controller, Browser Profile Launcher & Find 'Fast' Kangaroo Applet
- Lots more translation updates to budgie welcome
- Fixes to display Settings correctly translated
- Six bug & stability fixes for various applets

We also inherits hundreds of stability, bug-fixes and optimizations made to the underlying Ubuntu repositories. Many thanks to all the volunteers, Debian & Ubuntu maintainers and Canonical employees who have done such a sterling job packaging the changes that many more developers from all over the world have resolved. The power of FOSS that we are all proud to be part of.

You can read more about 18.04 via our [release notes](https://ubuntubudgie.org/blog/2018/03/08/18-04-release-notes) . Upgrade instructions from both 16.04 budgie-remix and 17.10 are included. Please have a read of these since there is an extra step you need to do post-upgrade.
