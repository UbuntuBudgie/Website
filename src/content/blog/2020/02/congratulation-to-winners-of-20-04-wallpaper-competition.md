We would like to thank all of our users that have participated in our Wallpaper Competition to select the desktop artwork for the upcoming Ubuntu Focal 20.04 LTS release of Ubuntu Budgie. There were a lot of great submissions that made our job of selecting winning ones a lot harder.

After careful consideration the team has selected these wallpapers:
