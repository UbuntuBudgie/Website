We are pleased to announce the release of the next version of our distro, the fifth 20.04 LTS point release.

The LTS version is supported for 3 years while the regular releases are supported for 9 months. This is our final point release for 20.04. Everyone is encouraged to make plans to uplift to 22.04 between now and April 2023 when end-of-support will be announced

The new release rolls-up various fixes and optimizations that have been released since the 20.04.4 release in February:

The kernel found in 22.04 has been backported to 20.04.5. This is part of the Hardware-Enablement-Stack release. 20.04(.1/2/3/4) users are automatically upgraded to the HWE (see later).

1. Budgie Welcome updates include lots more translation updates together with updates for the packages described below
2. Backports PPA updates to
    1. orchis-gtk-theme,
    2. mcmojave circle icon theme
    3. budgie-analogue-clock-applet

We also inherits hundreds of stability, bug-fixes and optimizations made to the underlying Ubuntu repositories. Many thanks to all the volunteers, Debian & Ubuntu maintainers and Canonical employees who have done such a sterling job packaging the changes that many more developers from all over the world have resolved. The power of FOSS that we are all proud to be part of.

You can read more about 20.04 via our [Release Notes](https://ubuntubudgie.org/2020/04/ubuntu-budgie-20-04lts-release-notes-for-18-04-upgraders/)

[Download links](https://ubuntubudgie.org/downloads/) and installation guide are provided. As always – do check the md256sum hash value of the downloaded ISO – this really does help you get on with a flying start for your install.

Remember, upgrades to the latest version of Ubuntu are entirely free of charge.

We recommend that all users read the the Ubuntu 20.04.4 [Release Notes](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/FocalFossa/ReleaseNotes/ChangeSummary/20.04.4), which document caveats and workarounds for known issues affecting all flavours including Ubuntu Budgie.

## HWE

The Ubuntu LTS enablement (also called HWE or Hardware Enablement) stack provides newer kernel support for existing Ubuntu LTS releases. This enablement stack will be installed automatically as part of your regular updates if you first installed from 20.04.1/ 20.04.2/ 20.04.3 or 20.04.4.
