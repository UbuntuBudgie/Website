We are pleased to announce the release of the next version of our distro, the 22.10 release.

This is a standard release supported for 9 months packed full of all sorts of new capabilities. If you want a well tested and longer term support then our 22.04.1 LTS version is supported for 3 years.

The new release has many new core updates as well as a bleeding edge version of budgie itself:

- The kernel is v5.19
- GNOME 43 stack with mutter 11
- Pipewire for everything audio related. This replaces pulseaudio
- budgie-desktop is 10.6.4 plus a whole suite of extra capabilities pending the v10.7 release due in the next few months.
- An overhaul of our default applications shipped in our distro.

We also inherit hundreds of stability, bug-fixes and optimizations made to the underlying Ubuntu repositories. Many thanks to all the volunteers, Debian & Ubuntu maintainers and Canonical employees who have done such a sterling job packaging the changes that many more developers from all over the world have resolved. The power of FOSS that we are all proud to be part of.

You can read more about 22.10 via our [Release Notes](https://ubuntubudgie.org/2022/09/ubuntu-budgie-22-10-release-notes/)

[Download links](https://ubuntubudgie.org/downloads/) and installation guide are provided. As always – do check the md256sum hash value of the downloaded ISO – this really does help you get on with a flying start for your install.

Remember, upgrades to the latest version of Ubuntu are entirely free of charge.

We recommend that all users read the the Ubuntu 22.10 [Release Notes](https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/kinetic-kudu-release-notes/27976), which document caveats and workarounds for known issues affecting all flavours including Ubuntu Budgie.
