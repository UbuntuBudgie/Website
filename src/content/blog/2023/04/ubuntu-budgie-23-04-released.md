We are pleased to announce the release of the next version of our distro, the 23.04 release for both the desktop and Raspberry Pi4.

This is a standard release supported for 9 months packed full of all sorts of new capabilities. If you want a well tested and longer term support then our 22.04.2 LTS version is supported for 3 years.

New with this release is a full backport of all the budgie components for our 22.04 LTS user community. We warmly recommend this combination - great stability with the very latest ‘everything budgie’.

The new release has many new core updates as well as the latest version of budgie itself:

- The kernel is v6.2

- GNOME 44 stack with mutter 12

- budgie-desktop is 10.7.1.

- Enhanced hotcorner capabilities with edge support

- Superb and intuitive tiling support using either/both mouse and keyboard

We also inherit hundreds of stability, bug-fixes and optimizations made to the underlying Ubuntu repositories. Many thanks to all the volunteers, Debian & Ubuntu maintainers and Canonical employees who have done such a sterling job packaging the changes that many more developers from all over the world have resolved. The power of FOSS that we are all proud to be part of.

You can read more about 23.04 via our [Release Notes](https://ubuntubudgie.org/2023/04/ubuntu-budgie-23-04-release-notes/)

[Download links](https://ubuntubudgie.org/downloads/) and installation guide are provided. As always – do check the md256sum hash value of the downloaded ISO – this really does help you get on with a flying start for your install.

Remember, upgrades to the latest version of Ubuntu are entirely free of charge.

We recommend that all users read the the Ubuntu 23.04 [Release Notes](https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/lobster-lunar-release-notes), which document caveats and workarounds for known issues affecting all flavours including Ubuntu Budgie.
